3004873730,Is The FedEx Deal Good For Microsoft Stock?,"Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and FedEx (NYSE:FDX) have entered a strategic partnership built around creating solutions to improve supply chain tracking. Overall, the partnership looks good for Microsoft stock. Notably, the agreement promises to increase the adoption of Microsoft’s Azure cloud services.

The aim is to combine FedEx’s global logistics network and the power of the Azure cloud to give customers more control and insight into the global movement of goods.

In the next few months, Microsoft and FedEx will launch a service called “FedEx Surround.” The service will let businesses track their inventory shipment in real-time. Azure cloud is trusted by 95% of the Fortune 500 companies. Microsoft stock jumped about 1.0% on Monday after the company announced the FedEx pact.

The FedEx deal promises to bring more cloud business to Microsoft, which should bode well for its t stock considering the massive revenue opportunity in the cloud market. According to Gartner estimates, the global cloud market is on course to generate over $266 billion in revenue in 2020. Meanwhile, the global cloud revenue could top $354 billion in 2022.

Currently, Microsoft trails Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) in the cloud market share. At the end of the first quarter, Amazon held a 32% share of the global cloud market. Microsoft ranks second with an 18% market share. Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is third with an 8.0% market share. So, partnerships like the one with FedEx could help Microsoft capture a bigger share of the cloud market.

The cloud business has become so important to Microsoft that investors have celebrated its cloud wins by bidding up the stock. For example, the stock has jumped more than 30% since the company landed the lucrative Pentagon JEDI cloud contract. However, Amazon has contested Microsoft’s JEDI contract win. The company claims that President Trump influenced the decision.

Microsoft recorded a 59% YoY (year-over-year) increase in Azure cloud revenue in the March quarter. That makes Azure the fastest-growing major cloud business. Amazon’s cloud revenue rose 32.5% and Google’s cloud revenue jumped 56% in the March quarter. Notably, Microsoft stock has risen about 8.0% since the company released its March quarter results showing strong growth in Azure cloud division.

At $183.63 per share at Tuesday’s closing, Microsoft stock has gained more 16.4% year-to-date. The stock still has a 5.4% upside potential to Wall Street’s average target price of $193.94.",en,neutral,0.5600970000000001,positive,0.46937799999999996,"['FedEx', 'Microsoft']","['Wall Street', 'Amazon', 'Pentagon', 'logistics', 'division', 'Fortune 500', 'market share', 'President Trump', 'supply chain', 'Microsoft', 'Gartner', 'NYSE', 'Google', 'cloud services', 'cloud', 'FedEx', 'NASDAQ', 'Currently', 'Trump', 'YoY', 'Azure', '“FedEx Surround', 'JEDI']","['Good', 'Deal', 'Microsoft', 'FedEx', 'Stock', 'Azure cloud', 'Microsoft stock', 'global cloud', 'cloud business', 'FedEx’s global', 'cloud', 'Azure', 'stock', 'global', 'companies', 'partnership', 'Street', 'businesses', 'Wall Street', 'Amazon', 'Pentagon', 'logistics', 'division', 'Fortune 500', 'market share', 'President Trump', 'supply chain', 'Gartner', 'NYSE', 'Google', 'cloud services', 'NASDAQ']","['#CloudComputing', '#Microsoft', '#FedEx', '#Amazon', '#NASDAQ', '#NASDAQ', '#MarketShare', '#Google', '#NYSE', '#NewYorkStockExchange', '#SupplyChain', '#Logistics', '#Fortune500', '#Gartner', '#ThePentagon', '#DonaldTrump', '#Division', '#WallStreet']",8,26,413,2477,2020-05-20 12:15:02+00:00,Market Realist,"{'avatar_url': None, 'id': 1186783, 'name': 'Ruchi Gupta'}","{'sentences': ['The FedEx deal promises to bring more cloud business to '

3004872483,Google says it won’t build AI tools for oil and gas drillers,"Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.

Google says it will no longer build custom artificial intelligence tools for speeding up oil and gas extraction, separating itself from cloud computing rivals Microsoft and Amazon.

A statement from the company Tuesday followed a Greenpeace report that documents how the three tech giants are using AI and computing power to help oil companies find and access oil and gas deposits in the U.S. and around the world.

The environmentalist group says Amazon, Microsoft and Google have been undermining their own climate change pledges by partnering with major oil companies including Shell, BP, Chevron and ExxonMobil that have looked for new technology to get more oil and gas out of the ground.

But the group applauded Google on Tuesday for taking a step away from those deals.

“While Google still has a few legacy contracts with oil and gas firms, we welcome this indication from Google that it will no longer build custom solutions for upstream oil and gas extraction,” said Elizabeth Jardim, senior corporate campaigner for Greenpeace USA.

Google said it will honor all existing contracts with its customers, but didn’t specify what companies. A Google cloud executive had earlier in May revealed the new policy during a video interview.

Greenpeace’s report says Microsoft appears to be leading the way with the most oil and contracts, “offering AI capabilities in all phases of oil production.” Amazon’s contracts are more focused on pipelines, shipping and fuel storage, according to the report. Their tools have been deployed to speed up shale extraction, especially from the Permian Basin of Texas and New Mexico.

Some of the contracts have led to internal protests by employees who are pushing their companies to do more to combat climate change.

Amazon declined to comment on the Greenpeace report, but pointed to wording on its website that said “the energy industry should have access to the same technologies as other industries.”

Microsoft published a blog statement Tuesday that didn’t address Greenpeace’s claims but emphasized the company’s commitment to remove from the air all the carbon it has ever emitted by 2050.",en,neutral,0.9745030000000001,neutral,0.8684930000000001,"['Google', 'oil', 'AI']","['breaking news', 'oil', 'Amazon', 'shale', 'New Mexico', 'carbon', 'BP', 'Greenpeace', 'Greenpeace USA', 'ExxonMobil', 'energy industry', 'artificial intelligence', 'AI', 'climate change', 'air', 'Permian Basin', 'Microsoft', 'Google', 'cloud computing', 'cloud', 'Texas', 'Chevron', 'oil companies', 'U.S', 'Elizabeth Jardim', 'Shell']","['drillers', 'Google', 'tools', 'oil', 'AI', 'Amazon’s contracts', 'company', 'reports', 'contracts', 'Greenpeace', 'Microsoft', 'Amazon', 'extraction', 'custom', 'Tuesday', 'cloud', 'access', 'breaking news', 'shale', 'New Mexico', 'carbon', 'BP', 'Greenpeace USA', 'ExxonMobil', 'energy industry', 'artificial intelligence', 'climate change', 'air', 'Permian Basin', 'cloud computing', 'Texas', 'Chevron', 'oil companies']","['#Google', '#Petroleum', '#Greenpeace', '#ArtificialIntelligence', '#Microsoft', '#Amazon', '#AI', '#CloudComputing', '#PetroleumIndustry', '#ClimateChange', '#BreakingNews', '#BP', '#BP', '#ChevronCorporation', '#ExxonMobil', '#Shale', '#PermianBasin', '#Texas', '#NewMexico', '#EnergyIndustry', '#AtmosphereOfEarth', '#Carbon']",11,15,368,2249,2020-05-20 12:11:42+00:00,NBC News,"{'avatar_url': None, 'id': 349742, 'name': 'Associated Press'}","{'sentences': ['Google says it will no longer build custom artificial '

3004922884,Google is partnering with the Department of Defense to fight cybercrime,"Google Cloud has landed a deal to help the Department of Defense combat cyber threats worldwide.
The deal will see Google's cloud division provide tools to the DoD's Defense Innovation Unit.
But it could also prove controversial. Google has seen backlash in the past over its military partnerships, and while this deal is unlike Project Maven, it could still prove contentious.
Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.





Google has landed a deal with the Department of Defense to use its Cloud tools to combat cyber threats.
In a statement, Google said its cloud tech would be used ""to detect, protect against, and respond to cyber threats worldwide,"" as part of the contract with the DoD's Defense Innovation Unit (DIU).
Google will provide a central control system that will allow the DIU to run its web services and applications across Google Cloud competitors including Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure.
But it could also be a controversial move for Google: The company faced backlash from employees for its last partnership with the Pentagon called Project Maven. It would have used Google's AI and machine learning to analyze drone footage, but was abandoned in 2019 after thousands of Google employees signed a petition protesting the deal.




As Google pulled back on its work with the Defense Department, other tech players have got ahead. This new deal comes just a few months after Microsoft secured the $10 billion JEDI cloud deal with the Pentagon.
Google was initially racing for that same contract, but pulled out, saying it conflicted with the company's AI principles. Microsoft's win is also currently being challenged by competitor Amazon.
While the specific value of the new Google Cloud deal is unknown, Axios says it is in the ""seven figures.""
Earlier this month, it was announced that Josh Marcuse, previously executive director of the Defense Innovation Board, was joining Google as head of strategy and innovation for global public sector.

3004842872,Google plans to stop making A.I. tools for oil and gas firms,"Google has pledged to stop building customized artificial intelligence (AI) tools that help oil and gas firms to extract fossil fuels worldwide.

The pledge came after a Greenpeace report on Tuesday highlighted how Google, Microsoft, and Amazon use AI and warehouse servers to help the likes of Shell, BP, and ExxonMobil to locate and retrieve oil and gas deposits from the earth.

""While Google still has a few legacy contracts with oil and gas firms, we welcome this indication from Google that it will no longer build custom solutions for upstream oil and gas extraction,"" said Elizabeth Jardim, senior corporate campaigner for Greenpeace USA, according to reports.

A spokesperson for Google was not immediately available when contacted by CNBC.

""Despite the biggest cloud companies' commitments to address climate change, Microsoft, Google, and Amazon all have connections to some of the world's dirtiest oil companies for the explicit purpose of getting more oil and gas out of the ground and onto the market faster and cheaper,"" the Greenpeace report reads.

Google has a reputation for being one of the greenest large tech firms in the world. Unlike other tech giants, it has been carbon neutral since 2007 by using strategies like buying renewable energy to match its use of non-renewable energy.

Amazon has pledged to be carbon neutral by 2040, while Microsoft has pledged to be carbon negative by 2030.

The Greenpeace report — titled ""How Tech Companies are Helping Big Oil Profit from Climate Destruction"" — calls out Microsoft as the tech giant with the most oil and gas contracts, claiming that it is ""offering AI capabilities in all phases of oil production.""

Microsoft responded to the report in a blog post that said it was encouraged by the growing number of energy sector commitments to transitioning to cleaner energy and lowering carbon emissions.

""We agree that the world confronts an urgent carbon problem and we all must do more and move faster to reach a net zero-carbon future,"" Microsoft wrote in the post.

3004967646,Microsoft Reimagines Azure,"Developers are the driver of innovation in the world we live in today, said Scott Guthrie, EVP of the Microsoft Cloud+AI Group, in his presentation during the virtual Build 2020 conference held Tuesday.

New features in Azure aim to make development easier and faster, he added.

""With Azure we built an end-to-end cloud that enables developers to focus on building applications and not have to worry about the underlying infrastructure the applications run on,"" Guthrie pointed out.

Azure ""is the first cloud with limitless data and analytics capabilities that can deliver a cloud-native data estate for every organization,"" said Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella. ""We literally rebuilt and reimagined the cloud data estate using the memory data hierarchy of the cloud.""

With Azure, GitHub and Visual Studio, ""we're building the most complete tool chain for developers,"" Nadella said. ""Fifty million developers use GitHub and they're more active than ever. Visual Studio is the most popular code editor.""

Other tools will be added to this toolkit, making the concept of a complete tool fluid, remarked Rob Enderle, principal analyst at the Enderle Group.

There are ""plenty of other toolchains,"" noted Holger Mueller, principal analyst at Constellation research.

""You have Google, Oracle, Java, IBM,"" he told the E-Commerce Times.

Still Azure ""is arguably one of the strongest tool sets available on any cloud platform,"" Enderle said.

Azure lets developers focus on applications and not the infrastructure, said Jeff Hollan, Microsoft's principal program manager for Azure Serverless. ""We have over 1,000 new features and improvements -- everything from Kubernetes to AI. We also have end-to-end solutions so you can partner with non-traditional developers.""

Microsoft's Azure-related announcements included updates for security, storage and analytics; .NET 5 Preview 4; ASP.NET Blazor support for WebAssembly; .NET MAUI; Project Bonsai and Project Moab; Azure VM Image Builder Service; new Azure IoT Central features; new Azure extensions for Visual Studio Code; and Static Web Apps.

Serverless capabilities are coming soon to Azure Cosmos DB, Hollan announced, which will let users run even spiky workloads efficiently.

They have an autoscale feature to instantly scale databases without increasing latency, and still provide 99.999 percent availability.

Azure Cognitive Services now offers an Apprentice Mode for Personalizer, which learns customer preferences in real time when run alongside existing solutions.

Azure Static Web Apps provide serverless hosting for dynamic scaling, GitHub native workflow, and unified hosting and management, said Amanda Silver, Microsoft's corporate VP of products for the Visual Studio family and developer tools.

""All you need to do is check in your code, fill and deploy,"" she said. ""Your code is deployed globally in minutes.""

Azure Synapse Link, which enables real-time data analytics, is ""the industry's first cloud-native implementation of hybrid transaction analytical processing,"" said Rohan Kumar, Microsoft's corporate VP, Azure Data Engineering.

""As soon as a transaction is recorded in your operational database, it will be available for analytics in seconds,"" he said.

Azure Synapse Link is available in Azure Cosmos DB now. It will be extended later to Microsoft's other operational database services.

New capabilities in Azure Machine Learning will enable developers to build AI that can be trusted, Kumar said.

Microsoft also announced one of the world's top five publicly disclosed supercomputers at Build, built in collaboration with, and exclusively for, OpenAI. Its infrastructure will be available to train extremely large AI models.

This was ""the biggest announcement"" in the Azure program at Build 2000, Enderle told the E-Commerce Times, ""because it could be instrumental in both finding a cure for COVID-19 and preventing the next pandemic.""

More than 95 percent of the Fortune 500 use Azure, Nadella pointed out.

""We're building Azure as the world's computer,"" he said.

Microsoft ""believes they are providing the world decentralized access to compute via the cloud,"" observed Ray Wang, principal analyst at Constellation Research.

""The reality is, this is also centralized compute, as AI and graphs play a key role in determining the signal intelligence in the future,"" he told the E-Commerce Times. ""Basically, everyone plugs in when it makes sense that aggregate information and insight, with permission and privacy, becomes the world's brain.""

Microsoft has 61 datacenter regions, which is more than Amazon and Google, Nadella pointed out, and Azure is ""the only cloud that extends to the edge.""

Microsoft does have the most datacenter locations, driven by Office365 and data residency requirements, said Constellation's Mueller, ""but when you count redundancy -- more than one datacenter in one location -- AWS has the most and Google is the most consistent.""

3004923202,Google is partnering with the Department of Defense to fight cybercrime,"Google Cloud has landed a deal to help the Department of Defense combat cyber threats worldwide.
The deal will see Google's cloud division provide tools to the DoD's Defense Innovation Unit.
But it could also prove controversial. Google has seen backlash in the past over its military partnerships, and while this deal is unlike Project Maven, it could still prove contentious.

Google has landed a deal with the Department of Defense to use its Cloud tools to combat cyber threats.
In a statement, Google said its cloud tech would be used ""to detect, protect against, and respond to cyber threats worldwide,"" as part of the contract with the DoD's Defense Innovation Unit (DIU).
Google will provide a central control system that will allow the DIU to run its web services and applications across Google Cloud competitors including Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure.
But it could also be a controversial move for Google: The company faced backlash from employees for its last partnership with the Pentagon called Project Maven. It would have used Google's AI and machine learning to analyze drone footage, but was abandoned in 2019 after thousands of Google employees signed a petition protesting the deal.




As Google pulled back on its work with the Defense Department, other tech players have got ahead. This new deal comes just a few months after Microsoft secured the $10 billion JEDI cloud deal with the Pentagon.
Google was initially racing for that same contract, but pulled out, saying it conflicted with the company's AI principles. Microsoft's win is also currently being challenged by competitor Amazon.
While the specific value of the new Google Cloud deal is unknown, Axios says it is in the ""seven figures.""
Earlier this month, it was announced that Josh Marcuse, previously executive director of the Defense Innovation Board, was joining Google as head of strategy and innovation for global public sector.

3004929916,Google Awarded 'Seven Figure' DoD Cloud Contract,"Alphabet's  (GOOGL) - Get Report Google landed a cloud contract with the U.S. Defense Department in the ""seven figures"" to help the federal government with cyberthreats, according to a news report Wednesday.

The department's Defense Innovation Unit (DIU) gave out the contract, according to an Axios report, to Google to help ""detect, protect against, and respond to cyber threats.""

Google told Axios that the deal was in the ""seven figures"" without being more specific.

""Multi-cloud is the future. This is now coming to the federal government as well,"" Mike Daniels, Google cloud vice president of public sector, told Axios.

The Google contract is part of the DIU's move towards what it calls a ""zero trust"" environment where devices are not able to access network resources simply based on their physical location.

Instead they want the devices to be granted access to network resources based on factors such as identity and behavior.

The DIU was founded during the Obama era in 2015. The DIU says that it operates ""at the intersection of technology, business, and national security."" It serves as a link between commercial technology and the U.S. military's own advancement efforts in five areas: AI, autonomy, cyber, human systems and space.

The Department of Defense recently came under scrutiny after Amazon  (AMZN) - Get Report filed a lawsuit claiming that the White House influenced a decision to award a massive $10 billion cloud contract to Microsoft  (MSFT) - Get Report because of President Trump's dislike of Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos.

That lawsuit has been put on hold for at least another three months following a court order in April.

3004926983,Microsoft launches 1st industry-specific offering in healthcare,"The Redmond, Washington-based tech giant made the announcement at its annual developer conference Tuesday. Cloud offerings that target specific verticals continues a trend among major cloud providers like Microsoft, Amazon and Google.

""Initially we are focused on the healthcare provider space, but we also plan to extend our capabilities across payers, pharma and life sciences,"" Tom McGuinness, Microsoft's corporate VP of healthcare, said at the product's launch.

Microsoft has been at the front of the movement to sell differentiated cloud offerings to the healthcare market for a while, analysts say. It's an emerging, but quickly saturated business.

Last year alone, Walgreens, Providence and Humana reached data-storage agreements with Microsoft; EHR vendor Cerner named Amazon Web Services its preferred cloud host; and nonprofit academic medical center Mayo Clinic inked a 10-year deal with Google.

Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare includes Microsoft 365, Dynamics, Power Platform and Azure aimed at managing patients and staff, deploying resources and promoting data insights.

HIPAA-compliant Microsoft Teams, for example, now includes the Bookings app for scheduling and virtual medical visits. New York City-based Stony Brook Medicine, St. Luke's University Health Network, Confluent Health and Calderdale & Huddersfield NHS Foundation Trust in the U.K. have been using Teams for virtual visits.

Microsoft also integrated Teams and Power Apps, Microsoft's app-builder tool, so providers can create their own in-house applications. For example, earlier this year, Swedish Health Services, the largest nonprofit in the Seattle area, used Power Apps to build a tool allowing hospital staff to track needed medical supplies in just two weeks amid the pandemic. Microsoft released the emergency response tool widely to providers in March.

Customers will also have access to the tech giant's partners ecosystem in healthcare, including Epic, Allscripts, GE Healthcare and Nuance, that can provide more specialized services.

One use case cited by Microsoft would be a patient with a medical concern logging into the patient portal and opening a chatbot to discuss symptoms. The chatbot can flag the conversation for a call center agent, who can schedule a telehealth visit and set an appointment, within the app.

The provider can reach out to the patient via the app in a few weeks to check whether the care plan is working. If the patient requires a follow-up appointment, their information will follow them within the EHR, even if it's a third-party system, Microsoft said.",en,neutral,0.736124,positive,0.566083,"['healthcare', 'Microsoft']","['pharma', 'scheduling', 'Mayo Clinic', 'healthcare', 'EHR', 'Redmond', 'NHS Foundation Trust', 'Seattle', 'Amazon', 'Tom McGuinness', 'academic medical center', 'developer conference', 'Amazon Web Services', 'University Health Network', 'Walgreens', 'GE Healthcare', 'Humana', 'New York', 'Nuance', 'nonprofit', 'Microsoft', 'telehealth', 'Google', 'Swedish Health Services', 'hospital', 'cloud', 'call center', 'pandemic', 'Huddersfield', 'U.K.', 'Cerner', 'Providence', 'ecosystem', 'logging', 'Calderdale', 'Washington', 'Cloud', 'New York City', 'U.K', 'Bookings', 'Customers', 'Allscripts', 'Power Apps', 'VP', 'Cloud for Healthcare', 'Dynamics', 'Power Platform and Azure', 'Microsoft Teams', 'Stony Brook Medicine', ""St. Luke's University Health Network"", 'Confluent Health', 'Calderdale & Huddersfield NHS Foundation Trust', 'Teams', 'Teams and Power Apps']","['healthcare', 'industry-specific', 'Microsoft', 'offering', 'healthcare provider', 'medical visits', 'providers', 'Cloud', 'medical', 'patients', 'Health', 'visits', 'giant', 'tool', 'center', 'Power', 'nonprofit', 'tech', 'pharma', 'scheduling', 'Mayo Clinic', 'EHR', 'Redmond', 'NHS Foundation Trust', 'Seattle', 'Amazon', 'Tom McGuinness', 'academic medical center', 'developer conference', 'chatbot', 'Amazon Web Services', 'University Health Network', 'Walgreens', 'GE Healthcare', 'Humana', 'New York', 'life sciences', 'Nuance', 'telehealth', 'Google', 'Swedish Health Services', 'hospital', 'cloud', 'call center', 'pandemic', 'Huddersfield', 'U.K.', 'Cerner', 'Providence', 'ecosystem', 'logging', 'Calderdale']","['#Microsoft', '#HealthCare', '#CloudComputing', '#Google', '#EHR', '#ElectronicHealthRecord', '#NonprofitOrganization', '#Chatbot', '#RedmondWashington', '#AppleWorldwideDevelopersConference', '#Amazon', '#PharmaceuticalIndustry', '#ListOfLifeSciences', '#TomMcGuinness', '#Walgreens', '#ProvidenceRhodeIsland', '#Humana', '#Cerner', '#AmazonWebServices', '#AcademicHealthScienceCentre', '#MayoClinic', '#Scheduling', '#NewYork', '#UniversityHealthNetwork', '#Calderdale', '#Huddersfield', '#NHSFoundationTrust', '#UnitedKingdom', '#SwedishMedicalCenter', '#Seattle', '#Hospital', '#Pandemic', '#Ecosystem', '#GEHealthcare', '#NuanceCommunications', '#Logging', '#CallCentre', '#Telehealth']",10,17,408,2587,2020-05-20 15:56:14+00:00,Healthcare Dive,"{'avatar_url': None, 'id': 980896, 'name': 'Rebecca Pifer'}","{'sentences': ['Cloud offerings that target specific verticals continues a '

				Google  dropped out of the Pentagon’s JEDI cloud contract battle fairly early in the game, citing it was in conflict with its “AI principals.” However, today the company announced a new 7 figure contract with DoD’s Defense Innovation Unit (DIU), a big win for the cloud unit and CEO Thomas Kurian.

While the company would not get specific about the number, the new contract involves using Anthos, the tool the company announced last year to secure DIU’s multi-cloud environment. In spite of the JEDI contract involving a single vendor, the DoD has always used solutions from all three major cloud vendors — Amazon, Microsoft and Google — and this solution will provide a way to monitor security across all three environments, according to the company.

“Multi-cloud is the future. The majority of commercial businesses run multi-cloud environments securely and seamlessly, and this is now coming to the federal government as well,” Mike Daniels, VP of Global Public Sector at Google Cloud told TechCrunch.

The idea is to manage security across three environments with help from cloud security vendor Netskope, which is also part of the deal.”The multi-cloud solution will be built on Anthos, allowing DIU to run web services and applications across Google Cloud, Amazon Web Services,  and Microsoft Azure — while being centrally managed from the Google Cloud Console,” the company wrote in a statement.

Daniels says that while this is a deal with DIU, he could see it expanding to other parts of DoD. “This is a contract with the DIU, but our expectation is that the DoD will look at the project as a model for how to implement their own security posture.”

Google Cloud Platform  remains way back in the cloud infrastructure pack in third place with around 8% market share. For context, AWS has around 33% market share and Microsoft has around 18%.

While JEDI, a $10 billion, winner-take-all prize remains mired in controversy and an on-going battle between The Pentagon, Amazon and Microsoft, this deal shows that the defense department is looking at advanced technology like Anthos to help it manage a multi-cloud world regardless of what happens with JEDI.",en,neutral,0.733684,negative,0.502599,"['Google Cloud', 'Anthos']","['CEO', 'prize', 'Amazon', 'Pentagon', 'The Pentagon', 'Google Cloud', 'Google Cloud Platform', 'Amazon Web Services', 'AWS', 'department', 'AI', 'market share', 'web services', 'Microsoft Azure', 'Microsoft', 'Google', 'cloud', 'TechCrunch', 'Thomas Kurian', 'Mike Daniels', 'Netskope', 'Daniels', 'Anthos', 'JEDI', 'DoD', 'Defense Innovation Unit', 'DIU', 'VP', 'Global Public Sector', 'Google Cloud Console']","['Anthos', 'contract', 'defense', 'multi-cloud', 'Cloud', 'management', 'Google', 'tool', 'Google Cloud', 'JEDI contract', 'multi-cloud environment', 'multi-cloud environments', 'company', 'JEDI', 'environment', 'Microsoft', 'deal', 'CEO', 'prize', 'Amazon', 'Pentagon', 'The Pentagon', 'Google Cloud Platform', 'Amazon Web Services', 'AWS', 'department', 'AI', 'market share', 'web services', 'Microsoft Azure', 'cloud', 'TechCrunch']","['#GoogleCloudPlatform', '#CloudComputing', '#Microsoft', '#Google', '#ThePentagon', '#Amazon', '#AmazonWebServices', '#MarketShare', '#AI', '#ArtificialIntelligence', '#CEO', '#ChiefExecutiveOfficer', '#TechCrunch', '#WebService', '#MicrosoftAzure', '#AWS', '#Prize', '#DepartmentsOfFrance']",14,13,379,2270,2020-05-20 16:20:22+00:00,TechCrunch,"{'avatar_url': None, 'id': 16835, 'name': 'Ron Miller'}","{'sentences': ['Google Cloud earns defense contract win for Anthos multi-cloud '

3004909317,Google's cloud division lands deal with the Department of Defense,"Google CEO Sundar Pichai speaks on stage during the annual Google I/O developers conference in Mountain View, California, May 8, 2018.

Google Cloud has landed a with the Department of Defense, the company announced Wednesday.

The deal is in the seven figure range, Axios reported ahead of the release.

The deal could thrust Google back into a controversial position. Google's former cloud chief told employees in 2018 that the company would not renew a different Defense contract after it was set to expire in March 2019. That announcement came after thousands of Google employees signed a letter urging their CEO to pull out of the contract and about a dozen resigned in protest.

The new contract, which is through the DoD's Defense Innovation Unit (DIU), will be focused on identifying cyber threats, according to the release. Google said the system ""will provide real-time network monitoring, access control, and full audit trails, enabling DIU to maintain its strict cloud security posture without compromising speed and reliability.""

3004963260,Amazon salesperson's pitch to oil and gas: 'Remember that we actually consume your products!',"Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos announces the co-founding of The Climate Pledge at the National Press Club on September 19, 2019, in Washington.

As Google's cloud unit steps back from the oil and gas industry, a sales rep at Amazon Web Services is courting customers by pointing out how many fossil fuel products the company uses today to power its business, while also underscoring Amazon's commitment to moving to renewable energy.

Earlier this week, environmental group Greenpeace released a report about cloud providers' work with oil companies. Google responded by telling news outlets, including CNBC, that it would not build custom artificial-intelligence algorithms for the oil and gas industry.

Brad Farmer, a Houston-based Amazon employee on AWS' oil and gas team for the central U.S., saw an opportunity. He published a LinkedIn post in which he pointed out that Amazon is a customer for oil companies' products.

""If you're an O&G company looking for a strategic digital transformation partner, we would recommend choosing a partner who actually uses your products and can help you transform for the future — instead of the non-existent Microsoft and Google planes/trucks/vans purchasing your products. $0 top-line value,"" Farmer wrote.

""Amazon buys jet fuel for our Amazon Prime Air planes! Amazon Middle Mile buys diesel for our 18-wheeler trucks! Amazon Last Mile buys gasoline for our blue Mercedes sprinter vans which you see in your neighborhoods!"" He contrasted that with Google, saying that it's ""embarrassed to be seen with O&G companies in public.""

Farmer also acknowledged Amazon's goal of becoming carbon-neutral by 2040: ""We also have a STRONG commitment to renewable energy sources as Amazon moves to net-zero carbon emissions by 2040 so we're actively engaged on renewable fuel supply discussions.""

Amazon did not immediately offer a comment on Farmer's post.

Fossil fuels and their contribution to climate change is a thorny subject for the company.

A group of Amazon employees have called for Amazon to end cloud contracts with companies that extract oil and gas. But Amazon has refused to end those contracts, saying the work helps energy companies ""reduce their demand for carbon fuel sources,"" and its website shows oil and gas customers like BP and Hess.

If Amazon were to scale back on oil and gas, that would provide an opening for its main competitor in the space, Microsoft Azure. Google, meanwhile, has had little success in the oil and gas space -- a spokesperson for the company told CNBC the sector makes up less than 1% of its cloud revenue in 2019, and that sales to the sector had declined from the previous year.

AWS controlled 47.8% of the cloud infrastructure market in 2018, while Microsoft had 15.5% and Google had 4%, according to Gartner.

An employee group called Amazon Employees for Climate Justice is widely credited for influencing Bezos' decision to announce a sweeping climate change plan last September. As part of the plan, Amazon has pledged to meet the goals of the Paris climate agreement by 2040, a decade ahead of the Paris accord's goal. The company also expects 80% of Amazon's energy use to come from renewable sources by 2024, up from a current rate of 40%, before transitioning to zero emissions by 2030.

Emily Cunningham, a former Amazon user experience designer and member of AECJ, characterized Amazon's work with oil and gas companies as lacking upside. In April, Amazon fired Cunningham and Maren Costa, also a user experience designer, from the company for breaking company rules.

""Amazon can't say it's leading on climate in one breath, and then in another, partner with fossil fuel companies to accelerate and expand oil extraction,"" Cunningham said. ""The fossil fuel industry is a dying industry. Even oil and gas companies know this. Partnering with Big Oil is not just morally repugnant, it's bad business.""",en,positive,0.381907,positive,0.839399,"['pitch', 'oil', 'Amazon']","['energy', 'jet fuel', 'CEO', 'renewable energy', 'renewable', 'oil', 'LinkedIn', 'Amazon', 'sprinter', 'CNBC', 'carbon', 'Washington', 'BP', 'Greenpeace', 'Amazon Web Services', 'AWS', 'fossil fuel', 'Jeff Bezos', 'Big Oil', 'artificial-intelligence', 'Paris', 'climate change', 'gasoline', 'National Press Club', '18-wheeler trucks', 'diesel', 'Microsoft', 'Gartner', 'Google', 'carbon emissions', 'cloud', 'oil companies', 'Paris climate agreement', 'Houston', 'U.S', 'Brad Farmer', 'Farmer', 'Fossil', 'Hess', 'Bezos', 'Emily Cunningham', 'Cunningham', 'Maren Costa', 'The Climate Pledge', 'O&G', 'Mercedes', 'STRONG', 'Amazon Employees for Climate Justice', 'AECJ']","['products', 'Amazon', 'salesperson', 'pitch', 'oil', 'Amazon employee', 'fuel companies', 'company', 'Google', 'Climate', 'cloud', 'fuel', 'customers', 'Farmer', 'employee', 'industry', 'renewable', 'group', 'energy', 'jet fuel', 'digital transformation', 'CEO', 'renewable energy', 'LinkedIn', 'Climate Justice', 'sprinter', 'carbon-neutral', 'CNBC', 'carbon', 'Washington', 'BP', 'Greenpeace', 'Amazon Web Services', 'AWS', 'fossil fuel', 'Jeff Bezos', 'Big Oil', 'artificial-intelligence', 'Paris', 'climate change', 'gasoline', 'National Press Club', '18-wheeler trucks', 'diesel', 'Microsoft', 'Gartner', 'user experience', 'carbon emissions', 'oil companies', 'Paris climate agreement']","['#Amazon', '#Petroleum', '#Google', '#CloudComputing', '#AmazonWebServices', '#FossilFuel', '#RenewableEnergy', '#PetroleumIndustry', '#CNBC', '#CNBC', '#AWS', '#Microsoft', '#ClimateChange', '#Energy', '#UserExperience', '#Pitch', '#CEO', '#ChiefExecutiveOfficer', '#JeffBezos', '#NationalPressClub', '#Washington', '#Greenpeace', '#ArtificialIntelligence', '#LinkedIn', '#DigitalTransformation', '#JetFuel', '#DieselEngine', '#SemitrailerTruck', '#Gasoline', '#Sprint', '#CarbonNeutrality', '#GreenhouseGas', '#Carbon', '#BP', '#BP', '#Gartner', '#ClimateJustice', '#ParisAgreement', '#Paris', '#BigOil']",15,29,663,3890,2020-05-20 19:19:20+00:00,CNBC,"{'avatar_url': None, 'id': 954854, 'name': 'Jordan Novet'}","{'sentences': [""As Google's cloud unit steps back from the oil and gas ""

3004952370,"HBO Max announces more launch partners; no deals yet with Amazon, Comcast, Roku","By Helen Coster
(Reuters) - HBO Max, the forthcoming streaming service from ATT Inc-owned WarnerMedia, announced on Wednesday several new partners will carry its content, but it has not yet announced deals with Comcast Corp, Amazon.com Inc or Roku Inc.
HBO Max will be available on Altice USA Inc, Cox Communications, Microsoft Corp, National Cable Television Cooperative (NCTC), Samsung, Sony Interactive Entertainment and Verizon Communications Inc when it launches on May 27, the company said.
The company had previously announced distribution deals with Apple Inc, Charter Communications Inc, Hulu and Alphabet Inc's Google and YouTube TV.
HBO Max is launching at a time when demand for new content is high - as more people are staying home due to the coronavirus - but consumers' income may have taken a hit as a result of the pandemic. The service will cost $15 per month for non-ATT customers; WarnerMedia is also offering lower-cost promotional deals and has said HBO Max will be free to some ATT customers at launch.
HBO Max will enter a crowded streaming landscape dominated by Netflix Inc, Walt Disney Co-owned Disney+, and Amazon Prime Video. It will include 10,000 hours of content from WarnerMedia brands and libraries such as Warner Bros, New Line Cinema and Cartoon Network. At launch it will include six original titles, including the underground ballroom dance competition series ""Legendary"" and a Sesame Workshop children's show ""The Not Too Late Show with Elmo.""

3005032647,Amazon Debuts Free Shooter PC Game 'Crucible',"Amazon has released a video game called “Crucible,” which bears similarities to popular titles like “Overwatch,” “Fortnite” and “League of Legends,” CNBC reported.

The PC game, a shooter, is free to play and is the first big-budget game released via Amazon Game Studios since its launch in 2012.

Amazon Game Studios is the gaming branch of the eCommerce giant, and the release of “Crucible” marks the first diversion away from the tablet games the division has been producing.

Gaming is not a chief concern for Amazon, which has focused more on Prime subscriptions in the past, although the company did make a $970 million investment in purchasing streaming platform Twitch in 2014. Twitch Prime was launched in 2016, giving users access to exclusive streaming content.

However, Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter speculated that the release of “Crucible” could be Amazon dipping its toes into the water of the gaming industry before carving out a larger niche later, similar to what it did with books and music, CNBC reported.

Pachter told CNBC that he believes Amazon won’t be deterred if “Crucible” isn’t a hit — it will keep tweaking its model with future games until the company gets it right, he theorized.

But Prime customers tend to be the bulk of the company’s entertainment priority, as those customers usually spend the most money and are the most loyal. Data from Consumer Intelligence Research in January year estimates Prime has more than 112 million customers, and they spend around $1,400 per year. By comparison, shoppers who weren’t members only spend $600 per year.

The launch of “Crucible” ranks Amazon along with Microsoft as the only big tech companies to make forays into the gaming space.

Others may be catching the bug — Google has launched its own gaming streaming service, Stadia, purchasing space in Montreal to do so. The service allows people to stream games onto their electronic devices without owning the respective consoles.

3005003394,Google wins DOD cloud pilot contract --,"The Pentagon's innovation arm awarded Google Cloud to build a multi-cloud security gateway that will hunt and respond to cyber threats.

The pilot contract with the Defense Innovation Unit – which makes awards using other transaction authority -- will focus on implementing zero-trust security in a multi-cloud environment, Google announced May 20.

Jeff Kleck, DIU's cyber portfolio director, told FCW in a statement that the project's objective is meant to ""enhance our security and control when accessing commercial cloud services, without impacting performance and usability.""

The solution, which includes network monitoring and audit trails, will be managed by Google Cloud Console but allows DOD to run services and applications across different platforms, including Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure.

Google has its eyes set on increasing its cloud business throughout DOD.

""This is a contract with the DIU, but our expectation is that the DOD will look at the project as a model for how to implement their own security posture,"" Mike Daniels, VP of Global Public Sector, Google Cloud, said in a statement.

The original solicitation from DIU is not indicated in the press release. Google's solution could be in answer to a November 2019 DIU solicitation for an ""alternative cloud security gateway"" that could be integrated into existing managed services and scale to service more than 500 users and 1,000 endpoints in the prototype phase.

That solicitation was pitched a developing an upgrade to DOD's existing Cloud Access Point gateway that connects commercial cloud offerings to DOD's networks at security levels at impact level 4 and above.

The production goals for the November solicitation were ambitious – ""the ability to scale to a minimum of 500,000 concurrent users and 1,000,000 endpoints."" The overall goals were to increase speed, reduce latency, maintain audit trails and support mobile and teleworking users.

Axios first reported the news ahead of the Google release, and indicated that the contract was between $1 million and $10 million.

Billy Mitchell							 May 20, 2020 | FEDSCOOP
                            Google Cloud has worked its way back into the Department of Defense‘s cloud environment with a new pilot contract to provide a secure multi-cloud management system for the department.

The Defense Innovation Unit awarded a one-year contract to Google Cloud to build a secure cloud management solution on its open-source, multi-cloud Anthos platform, which will allow DIU to manage services and applications across a variety of commercial cloud platforms, including Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services and, of course, Google Cloud.

DIU is the Pentagon’s Silicon Valley-based innovation liaison created to boost work with commercial tech companies. Typically, DIU awards smaller pilot contracts called other transaction agreements (OTAs) that, if successful, can result in larger, scaled production contracts. A spokesperson on behalf of Google said the contract is a “seven-figure deal” and that the hope is to scale the work with DIU across the Pentagon.

“DIU engages technology vendors for the Defense Department through fast and efficient commercial cloud services,” Jeff Kleck, DIU cyber portfolio director, told FedScoop. “DIU’s secure cloud management project’s objective is to enhance our security and control when accessing commercial cloud services, without impacting performance and usability.”

Mike Daniels, vice president of global public sector for Google Cloud,” said in a statement that the “expectation is that the DoD will look at the project as a model for how to implement their own security posture.”

The contract comes after Google stood down from several major defense technology projects in recent years, including the Pentagon’s premier Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure (JEDI) cloud contract, which it said didn’t sit right with the company’s ethical views at the time. Google also notably walked away from a major artificial intelligence contract with the DOD, Project Maven, after employees protested the project and resigned from the company, again because of the ethics surrounding it. Some officials said it left them with a negative perception of Google as a partner to American national security, despite its reputation as one of the top cloud providers in the federal space.

But Google has since been working to develop its own ethical principles for how it navigates the sensitive arena of defense technology. Kent Walker, senior vice president of global affairs for Google, said last fall it was “frustrating to hear concerns around our commitment to national security and defense. In addition to its reluctance to work with the DOD on JEDI and Project Maven, Google has also bee condemned for its work providing AI development services in China, the U.S.’s biggest military technology competitor.

Walker explained Google stepping away from Maven as “an area where it’s right that we decided to press the reset button until we had the opportunity to develop our own set of AI principles, our own work with regard to internal standards and review processes. But that was a decision focused on a discrete contract — not a broader statement about our willingness or our history of working with the Department of Defense.”

The DIU contract also signals that DOD is leaning toward a multi-cloud future despite the single-award nature of the $10 billion JEDI contract, which Microsoft won last fall. Google’s Anthos, because it is open source, allows DIU to securely manage services from multiple providers at once.

“Multi-cloud is the future. The majority of commercial businesses run multi-cloud environments securely and seamlessly, and this is now coming to the federal government as well,” Daniels said.

The contract also provides Google’s Istio for distributed microservice orchestration and Netskope for cloud security.

Combined, these services provide for better network throughput and access control, reduced costs, enhanced mobility and quicker deployment of services, Google says in a release.

“Google Cloud is a pioneer in ‘zero trust’ security and in deploying innovative approaches to protecting and securing networks worldwide,” Daniels said. “We’re honored to partner with DIU on this critical initiative to protect its network from bad actors that pose threats to our national security.”",en,neutral,0.8442149999999999,neutral,0.808901,"['Google', 'cloud', 'DOD', 'DIU']","['public sector', 'usability', 'Maven', 'global affairs', 'ethics', 'bee', 'national security', 'Pentagon', 'defense technology', 'Google Cloud', 'Enterprise', 'Amazon Web Services', 'orchestration', 'department', 'artificial intelligence', 'AI', 'Kent', 'Defense Department', 'arena', 'Microsoft Azure', 'Billy Mitchell', 'throughput', 'Microsoft', 'China', 'Google', 'cloud', 'cloud services', 'Kleck', 'access control', 'Silicon Valley', 'U.S', 'Istio', '” Jeff Kleck', 'Mike Daniels', 'Kent Walker', 'Walker', 'Daniels', 'Netskope', 'Combined', 'Multi', 'FEDSCOOP', 'Department of Defense', 'The Defense Innovation Unit', 'Anthos', 'DIU', 'FedScoop', 'DoD', 'Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure', 'JEDI', 'DOD', 'Project Maven', 'Google’s Anthos']","['conversation', 'cloud', 'pilot', 'Google', 'contract', 'Google Cloud', 'cloud contract', 'secure cloud', 'commercial cloud', 'Cloud', 'secure', 'services', 'Defense', 'work', 'project', 'public sector', 'usability', 'Maven', 'global affairs', 'ethics', 'bee', 'national security', 'Pentagon', 'defense technology', 'open-source', 'open source', 'Enterprise', 'Amazon Web Services', 'orchestration', 'department', 'artificial intelligence', 'AI', 'Kent', 'Defense Department', 'arena', 'Microsoft Azure', 'Billy Mitchell', 'throughput', 'Microsoft', 'China', 'cloud services', 'Kleck', 'access control']","['#Google', '#CloudComputing', '#GoogleCloudPlatform', '#ThePentagon', '#ArtificialIntelligence', '#ApacheMaven', '#NationalSecurity', '#OpensourceModel', '#MilitaryTechnology', '#AI', '#BillyMitchell', '#DepartmentsOfFrance', '#MicrosoftAzure', '#AmazonWebServices', '#UnitedStatesDepartmentOfDefense', '#GaryKleck', '#Usability', '#PublicSector', '#Enterprise', '#Ethics', '#Arena', '#Kent', '#Globalization', '#Bee', '#China', '#Microsoft', '#Orchestration', '#Throughput', '#AccessControl']",17,24,687,4374,2020-05-20 20:53:43+00:00,FedScoop,"{'avatar_url': None, 'id': 1036100, 'name': 'Billy Mitchell'}","{'sentences': ['Written by\n'

3004887857,Windows 10 Warning: Anger At Microsoft Rises With Serious New Failure,"05/20 Update below. This post was originally published on May 19
 
Microsoft has made some big Windows 10 promises recently and put out a lot of fires. The problem is the fires keep coming and now a new Windows 10 update is wrecking PCs.

Picked up by the always-excellent BleepingComputer, Microsoft’s new KB4556799 Windows 10 update is causing a myriad of problems for users, including Blue Screen of Death (BSOD) crashes, deleted data, performance issues, broken audio and more. And users are not happy. 
 
 
“My system has been a wreck since this update (KB4556799),” said one impacted user. “I've had the machine for a month with no issues until this week. My system started throwing BSOD and rebooting over and over all night, to the point where I had to reset Windows to even be able to log back in.” 
 
“I installed the update and audio drivers are missing,” said another. “The Troubleshooter is also not working and I am unable to uninstall the update because buttons within Settings are also not working.”
 
 
“My computer automatically updated to this version and ALL of my computer files were deleted,” another user reports. “I am not sure how to recover them and I don’t want to make the problem worse.”

There are also reports of impacted gaming performance (yes, yet again), broken web browsing (also familiar) and more. Yet, for its part, Microsoft has not acknowledged any of these issues with its official KB4556799 update page saying the company “is not currently aware of any issues with this update.” I have reached out to Microsoft and will update this post when I know more. 
 
05/20 Update: Microsoft has made a major announcement to try and improve the reliability of software on Windows 10 with the launch of 'Project Reunion'. The project is designed to unify win32 desktop apps and Universal Windows Platform (UWP) apps, which should deliver slicker, more stable software on Windows 10. “We’re bringing together the combined power of win32 and UWP so developers no longer have to choose because we’re unifying these existing APIs and in some way decoupling them from the OS,” explains Rajesh Jha, the executive VP of Microsoft’s Experiences and Devices Group. This has been a strategy at Microsoft behind the scenes for some time, so for it to now be front and centre can only be a good thing. 
 
While not everyone has been able to uninstall KB4556799, if you are impacted by these problems you can follow this guide to try and remove it. That aside, this is a sadly familiar story with Windows 10 updates deleting user data in February, breaking audio in March, compromising Chrome security in April and impacting performance of major games this month. 
 
With Windows 10X now being refocused for desktop and laptop PCs and Windows 10 updates tipped for a serious overhaul, big changes are coming to the Microsoft ecosystem. The problem is, they are not coming fast enough.

3004854702,Microsoft debuts supercomputer to create human-like A.I.,"ANALYSIS/OPINION:

                        

                        

                      

                      Microsoft announced it has built a new supercomputer that will be used to train artificial intelligence models — meaning, develop new technology with human-like capacity.


                      

                      

                      

                    
                      

                      

                      Making humans out of machines: it’s been the dream of the mad A.I. scientists from day one.


                      

                      

                      

                    
                      

                      

                      It’s the reason Tesla co-founder and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has issued warning after warning about the need to control A.I. development, or else face destruction of humanity.


                      

                        

                      

                      

                      

                    
                      

                      

                      “[A.I.] is a fundamental existential risk for human civilization,” Musk said in July 2017, as The Independent reported.


                      

                      

                      

                    
                      

                      

                      “A.I.’s a rare case where I think we need to be proactive in regulation instead of reactive,” Musk said at the same time.


                      

                      
                      
                        
                        
                        
                      

                      

                      

                    
                      

                      

                      “[With A.I.], there’s a lot of risk in concentration of power. So if AGI [artificial general intelligence] represents an extreme level of power, should that be controlled by a few people at Google with no oversight?” he said in November 2017.


                      

                      

                      
                        
                        
                        
                        
                        
                        
                        
                        
                        
                        
                        
                        

                        

                      

                    
                      

                      

                      “Mark my words — A.I. is far more dangerous than nukes,’ he said, in March 2018.


                      

                      

                      

                    
                      

                      

                      “[A.I. could create] an immortal dictator from which we can never escape,” he said in April 2018.


                      

                      

                      

                    
                      

                      

                      “Artificial intelligence isn’t necessarily bad, but it will operate outside of human control,” he said in September 2018.


                      

                      

                      

                    
                      
                        
                      

                      

                      “If advanced AI (beyond basic bots) hasn’t been applied to manipulate social media, it won’t be long before it is,” he tweeted in September 2019.


                      

                      

                      

                    

                    
                      Get the picture?

                    
                      The new supercomputer Microsoft built is going to be used to train OpenAI’s models — OpenAI being the company funded in part by none other than Musk in 2015. Musk has since left; Sam Altman now heads up the endeavor.

                    
                      Of course, plenty think Musk is off-base when it comes to artificial intelligence.

                    
                      “He is sensationalist,” said one A.I. executive quoted in CNBC just this month, in reference to Musk. “He veers wildly between openly worrying about the downside risk of the technology and then hyping the artificial general intelligence agenda.”

                    
                      Maybe.

                    
                      And yet — here we are: Microsoft “is working to create artificial general intelligence, or AI that is capable of outperforming humans,” Yahoo! Finance reported.

                    
                      We have met the enemy, and he is us.

3004969502,Facebook and Amazon's new rivalry is heating up,"A rivalry is heating up between Facebook and Amazon that could lead to a power struggle between the social networking giant and the ecommerce titan over everything from ad sales to where consumers shop online.
The latest salvo came on Tuesday when Facebook (FB) announced its newest venture into the ecommerce realm with the launch of its Facebook Shops storefront. Available now, Facebook Shops lets retailers set up their own ecommerce portals that are accessible from their existing Facebook profiles.

And just as Facebook is leaning more into ecommerce, Amazon (AMZN) is digging deeper into the online advertising market. In the company’s most recent quarter, Amazon’s “Other” business segment, which is made up largely of its advertising division, saw 44% year-over-year growth, topping out at $3.9 billion.
That’s still a far cry from Facebook’s Q1 2020 advertising revenue of $17.4 billion, but Amazon’s year-over-year advertising growth has been around the 40% range for the past five quarters, and according to a report from eMarketer, the company currently sits in third place behind Google and Facebook in terms of advertising market share.
It’s clear that Amazon is going to continue to push into advertising as hard as possible, which is sure to irk the higher ups at Facebook. But two can play that game, which is where Facebook Shops comes in.
To get the program running, Facebook is teaming with ecommerce heavyweights like Shopify (SHOP), BigCommerce, and others to help businesses set up their online portals. Shops won’t just be on Facebook, though. The social media firm says that it will bring a similar shopping experience to Instagram, as well as WhatsApp and Messenger. That would open Shops up to every one of Facebook’s 2.6 billion monthly active users.
“We see a material opportunity to improve user monetization across FB and IG in the eCommerce vertical (more relevant products, less purchasing friction = higher conversion rates),” BofA Securities analyst Justin Post wrote in a research note following’s Facebook’s announcement.
“Given the opportunity, we think any signs of traction for Instagram / Facebook shopping could be a potential catalyst for FB in '20/'21, while Amazon, eBay and Google could see some (small) sentiment risk,” he added.

Facebook will also add chat to its arsenal in its drive to becoming an even bigger ecommerce contender. The company says it will allow merchants to communicate directly with customers via Messenger, WhatsApp, and Instagram Direct to do everything from offering support to providing order tracking information.
And then there’s the live component of Facebook Shops, which will allow for a QVC-esque live video shopping experience via Instagram, which influencers are sure to glom on to the minute it’s available.
As Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak points out, Instagram has the opportunity to bring in $4 billion in sales annually. 
“We believe consumer ecommerce behavior is moving in FB's direction and over time these new offerings could lead to even broader social shopping (and FB monetization) from small and medium sized businesses … to larger retailers/brands,” he wrote in a research note.
Facebook will increasingly move in on Amazon’s share of the small and medium business marketplace, while Amazon will continue to strike into the advertising market. And while both companies will continue to maintain commanding leads in their respective sectors, expect them to view each other as greater rivals in their spaces, and make moves to push back against their new competitors in the years ahead.

3004972373,How IBM is leading through change and highlighting the critical role of IT infrastructure,"By Tom Rosamilia, SVP, IBM Systems and Chairman, North America
Every business is exploring new ways to serve its customers digitally and support employees who are balancing work, home life, and their families' health. As a business leader, I'm committed to helping our employees, clients, and partners with their efforts to navigate the uncertainty we're all facing during this pandemic.
For several weeks now, I've been serving as co-chair for IBM's COVID-19 Executive Response Team. I've learned a great deal about leading during a time of crisis and have seen the invaluable impact of technology and infrastructure. That's why I spoke at IBM Think Digital about how business and IT leaders can manage through change and the role IT infrastructure plays in driving and achieving new business objectives. Whether you are on a path to recovery or discovery, I have some key insights to share about leading in this unprecedented time. Below is a clip from my Think Digital discussion, and you can watch the full session here.
No matter the industry you are in right now, the common denominator for business disruption is a need for a resilient, flexible, and secure IT infrastructure.
We are seeing more organizations react to changes in the market and the world by deploying hybrid multicloud to manage their operations, process transactions, and serve customers. Some examples include: 
The education system and the never-before-seen availability of online learning for students of all ages relying on cloud infrastructures.
The massive increase in volume for call centers and the application of artificial intelligence for natural language processing to help manage these calls and quickly get people the answers they need.
Supply chains and the potential for blockchains to provide more reliability, a higher degree of data visibility, and greater transaction accuracy for their customers and business partners.

Digital transformation is about changing the way you use technology and your data. It's about building a better culture to deliver value throughout your company and in a more personalized way.
Over the past several months, IBM has taken some important steps to keep our employees safe. Like many, IBM has shifted to a remote work model, is taking extra precautions at manufacturing and client sites, and maintains transparent and frequent communication with IBMers about the guidance, resources, and tools they need to adjust and be effective while keeping themselves and their families healthy. IBM's commitment to leading teams through change includes our clients and society. Here are some of the featured IBM initiatives in science and research, trusted information, and resiliency and adaptation we are releasing to help.
Fighting the virus takes a supercomputer: Now, the world's most powerful high-performance computing resources, based on our IBM Power Systems™ technology, are being used by government, industry, and academic leaders to understand the threat we face and develop strategies to address it.

Using data for good: IBM is bringing together trusted data from governments, the World Health Organization, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to give over 300 million monthly visitors to The Weather Channel access to detailed, trusted, up-to-date virus tracking information with AI from Watson.
Meet the High-Performance Computing Consortium: This unique private-public research effort between 11 technology companies, seven laboratories, 10 universities, and two government agencies provides a range of computing services and expertise to accelerate COVID-19 research.

To support businesses everywhere, IBM has made its flagship event content free for all to view. Explore hundreds of on-demand sessions by topic and industry right now. Learn new ways to work remotely, manage risk, and optimize costs to maintain your customers.
Hear from featured speakers addressing issues that organizations face today.

3004901232,Microsoft Builds Massive Supercomputer For OpenAI,"Microsoft has announced that the company has built a top 5 AI supercomputer for OpenAI, hosted in the Azure cloud. Microsoft invested a billion dollars in the OpenAI industry research group in 2019. The massive system is comprised of some 10,000 GPUs and over 285,000 CPU cores and will be used to advance the industry’s capabilities in dealing with very large AI models, which are doubling in size every 3.5 months, according to OpenAI. Microsoft’s Turing model for natural language generation contains some 17 Billion parameters, which is a 17-fold increase over last years largest model. So this supercomputer will be put to very good use.
 
Strangely, Microsoft failed to name the computer (an unheard-of omission in the Supercomputer world) and declined to communicate any system configuration details that a user must understand: which GPU’s development stack, which CPU and the number of cores  threads per socket, which networking interface, and the configuration of each node (#CPUs and #GPUs). While no spokesperson would confirm my suspicions on the record, I think I can shed some light on these important factors.

Whose GPUs were used? NVIDIA V100
 
 
First, the GPU’s must be NVIDIA V100s because a) NVIDIA just announced the A100 and would be hard-pressed to deliver 10,000 units before they launched it last week. And b) the GPU’s cannot be AMD Radeons because those GPUs do not yet enjoy the ecosystem required to support the research underway at OpenAI. So, by the process of elimination, one must conclude that the GPU’s are in fact NVIDIA V100s. At 10,000 units, let’s assume that Microsoft got a seriously sweet deal and paid only $5,000 each, which would perhaps produce some $50M in revenue for NVIDIA, likely in the last quarter. When asked, an NVIDIA spokesperson confirmed my logic but declined to be identified.
 
Whose CPUs were used? AMD EPYC Rome
 
As for the CPU sockets, the math says they are AMD EPYC Rome CPUs; there are just not enough cores in an Intel Xeon to make the numbers work unless Microsoft spent big bucks for the top-shelf 56-core Xeons. At 285,000 cores, let’s assume it is AMD’s 64-core CPU in a two-socket configuration. That would imply some 2220 nodes. At 4 GPUs each, that would connect to some 8800 GPUs, so at least we are in the 10,000 GPU Zip code. When asked, an informed source confirmed my logic here as well, confirming the use of AMD EPYC, but requested anonymity. 
 
 
As for the interconnect, NVIDIA’s acquisition of Mellanox, and their leadership in the supercomputer space would favor InfiniBand, so that is my assumption.
 
Conclusions
 
 While I understand that Microsoft and OpenAI wanted to focus the announcement on them and the great research they are undertaking, I find their approach quite old-school, and inconsistent with the culture transformed by Satya Nadella. In an open IT world, such facts are critical and should have been included in the announcement. The company used a comic-like drawing instead of a glamour shot as well, so we cannot tell which system was used (I assume it was an Open Compute HGX, but …). Oh, well. A little detective work leads me to conclude that AMD, NVIDIA, and probably Mellanox won the sockets. And the world of AI research will benefit from their leading technology and efforts; they deserve the credit.",en,neutral,0.621208,positive,0.961817,"['Microsoft', 'Supercomputer', 'Microsoft Builds Massive Supercomputer', 'OpenAI']","['Mellanox', 'stack', 'AMD', 'Rome', 'CPU', 'NVIDIA', 'Xeon', 'Intel', 'AI', 'detective', 'logic', 'Satya Nadella', 'Microsoft', 'InfiniBand', 'cloud', 'GPUs', 'GPU', 'supercomputer', 'Supercomputer', 'ecosystem', 'natural language generation', 'OpenAI', 'Whose', 'Xeons', 'Conclusions', 'Open Compute HGX', 'Figure', 'Zip', 'Azure', 'NVIDIA V100\n \n \nFirst', 'NVIDIA V100s', 'AMD Radeons', 'Intel Xeon']","['Massive', 'Microsoft', 'OpenAI', 'Supercomputer', 'supercomputer Microsoft', 'NVIDIA', 'supercomputer', 'cores', 'GPUs', 'models', 'announcement', 'system', 'socket', 'configuration', 'open', 'fact', 'Mellanox', 'spokesperson', 'industry', 'stack', 'AMD', 'Rome', 'CPU', 'Xeon', 'Intel', 'AI', 'detective', 'logic', 'Satya Nadella', 'Zip code', 'InfiniBand', 'cloud', 'GPU', 'ecosystem', 'natural language generation']","['#Microsoft', '#GraphicsProcessingUnit', '#NVIDIA', '#Nvidia', '#Supercomputer', '#AMD', '#AdvancedMicroDevices', '#GPU', '#CPU', '#CentralProcessingUnit', '#AI', '#ArtificialIntelligence', '#Logic', '#Rome', '#MellanoxTechnologies', '#CloudComputing', '#NaturalLanguageGeneration', '#Stack', '#Ecosystem', '#Intel', '#Xeon', '#ZIPCode', '#InfiniBand', '#SatyaNadella', '#Detective']",31,27,613,3577,2020-05-20 13:58:50+00:00,Forbes,"{'avatar_url': None, 'id': 2547385, 'name': 'Moor Insights'}","{'sentences': ['The massive system is comprised of some 10,000 GPUs and over '

3004914870,Perficient Named a 2020 Microsoft Health Innovation Award Winner,"ST. LOUIS--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
Perficient, Inc. (Nasdaq: PRFT) (“Perficient”), the leading global digital consultancy transforming the world’s largest enterprises and biggest brands, today announced that it has been recognized by Microsoft as a 2020 Health Innovation Award winner in the “Enable Personalized Care” category.



The awards recognize health organizations and their technology solution partners for using Microsoft’s technology solutions in innovative ways to help enable personalized care, empower care teams, improve operational outcomes, protect health information, and ultimately reimagine healthcare. The 2020 winners are impacting the industry by creating breakthrough solutions that advance health and life sciences organizations, while meeting global, local, and industry-specific compliance and security standards.



“We are honored to be recognized with this Health Innovation Award from Microsoft,” said Juliet Silver, healthcare Chief Strategist, Perficient. “Digital transformation is pushing the boundaries of traditional healthcare models with offerings like telemedicine, virtual visits, and patient-specific portals quickly becoming standard expected services. Our approach to digital healthcare combines strategy, data, technology, and design to streamline internal processes and deliver personalized experiences for patients that improve quality of care.”



Perficient Improves the Digital Health Experience for One of the Largest U.S. Healthcare Systems



Today’s healthcare organizations must invest to meet consumers’ rising expectations for convenient and customized digital services. They must also deliver positive experiences at every touchpoint throughout the patient journey to help optimize clinical outcomes. One of the largest healthcare systems in the United States partnered with Perficient to develop a unified digital experience that provides a personalized and seamless end-to-end experience for patients.



Perficient created a new Sitecore-based platform deployed on Microsoft Azure to support customization while incorporating functionality that makes it easier for users to find a doctor, book an appointment online, and manage self-service tasks through a patient portal. Perficient then leveraged the continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) capabilities of Azure DevOps to standardize the user experience, interface, and content across the site. Using Azure Search and other Azure PaaS services, Perficient implemented a full release strategy that allowed deployment and testing to occur with no disruption to end-users and Sitecore content authors. To access the data needed to create a unique experience for each user, Perficient also accelerated the deployment of Microsoft Dynamics 365 and facilitated its integration with multiple technology platforms and services throughout the organization.



The healthcare system now has a centralized location where it can access near real-time data to deliver highly personalized patient experiences based on a user’s activity. As a result, the healthcare system has realized an increase in user interactions and bookings with the platform as well as in provider enrollments.



Perficient is a trusted end-to-end digital partner with more than 20 years of experience delivering digital technology solutions to leading enterprises, including healthcare payer, provider, and pharmaceutical organizations. With a focus on the healthcare consumer experience, Perficient helps healthcare organizations design and implement solutions that enable interoperability, satisfy regulatory requirements, leverage key data insights, and improve quality of care.



“During this both challenging and transformational time in the healthcare industry, organizations are using technology to profoundly impact how they deliver care, evolve business operations, and help people,” said Patty Obermaier, Microsoft Vice President of U.S. Health and Life Sciences. “This year's Microsoft Health Innovation Award recipients are advancing the goals of improved patient engagement and care coordination through their innovative use of Microsoft devices, platforms and cloud and AI services.”



Nominations were submitted by health providers, payers, pharmaceutical and life science organizations, and public and private health institutions across the world for applying Microsoft technology to create transformative and highly-effective innovations. An esteemed panel of industry experts selected this year’s winners based on how their innovations represented a forward-thinking development or implementation of a solution that is delivering groundbreaking results and producing better health outcomes for more people. Recipients will be highlighted on the Microsoft in Health blog at www.Microsoft.com/Health.

3004800226,Microsoft Launches Cloud-Based Platform For Healthcare Organizations,"Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) is launching a cloud-based software solution which is tailored to provide a platform for the specific needs of healthcare groups.

The tech giant’s first industry-specific cloud offering, also known as Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare, seeks to provide automation on high-value workflows, as well as combine deep data analytics to better connect health teams and improve collaboration, decision-making, and operational efficiencies.

As such the cloud software solution will enable hospitals to collate data throughout an interaction with a patient, which will allow them to create individualized care plans, deploy secure virtual visits, chatbot assessments, and remote health monitoring.








“Healthcare will be the first industry served with additional industry-specific clouds to follow,” said Tom McGuinness, VC of Wordwide Health at Microsoft.

For now, Microsoft is making the healthcare cloud platform available through a free trial for the next six months.

The offering come as Microsoft just announced a collaboration with UnitedHealth Group (UNH) for an everyday free screening app for coronavirus symptoms as more and more employers are planning to reopen their businesses and are subject to stringent health requirements.

The tech giant said it is already working closely with health system providers from organizations like Accenture, KPMG, and Nuance to co-develop new solutions with leaders in their respective sectors like Humana, Providence, Novartis, and Walgreens Boots Alliance.

Five-star analyst Alex Zukin at RBC Capital raised Microsoft’s price target to $200 from $196 and kept his Buy rating on the shares after hosting meetings with investors.

Zukin said that although Microsoft will not be immune to macro demand trends, its broad product portfolio should benefit from increasing cloud demand as more companies seek to adopt its cloud and collaboration offerings to better enable remote work, disaster recovery, and flexibility. Zukin expects Microsoft’s revenue and gross profit growth to accelerate as Azure and Office 365 expand within its sales mix.

TipRanks data shows that overall Wall Street analysts are almost unanimously bullish on Microsoft’s stock. Twenty-one out of the 22 analysts have Buy ratings and 1 has a Hold rating adding up to a Strong Buy consensus. The $198.89 average price target provides investors with 8.6% upside potential in the shares in the coming 12 months. (See Microsoft stock analysis on TipRanks).

3004924779,Microsoft strengthens its RPA portfolio with Softomotive acquisition,"Earlier this week, Microsoft announced the planned acquisition of Softomotive, a UK-headquartered robotic process automation (RPA) software company with roots in Greece. With the intended purchase, Microsoft has muscled into the RPA game in a big way and, in doing so, removed any doubts that RPA has really arrived. Expect others to follow suit with a buying spree and resulting shakeout of the weaker players. Given the current recession and focus on projects that reduce cost, the timing could not be better.

    
        Most of Softomotive's 8,000-plus customers are single users or small work groups. Softomotive's WinAutomation product has both attended and unattended deployment options and a solid offering that is flexible and easy to use but not exercised generally for complex use cases. Functionally, the acquisition helps in three primary areas.
Microsoft took a cloud-first approach to UI Flows. (Be patient with me here.) Power Automate, formerly Microsoft Flow, is the automation backbone for UI Flows and only runs in the cloud. This made running a bot on a desktop awkward. You could do it, but it needed a persistent internet connection, limiting its appeal for many customer service use cases. The acquired WinAutomation has a competitive attended-mode solution and gets over this restriction. The UI Flows offering will remain in the market but mostly for unattended-mode use cases.
Secondly, Microsoft's bot design support gets a major facelift. The web-based designer of UI Flows could not compete with major RPA design studios, which have a richer set of thick-client design features.
A third positive is picking up surface automation features, the primary talent of RPA products, and a significant RD area for the majors. Application control and UI surface automation for Citrix, green screens, and hundreds of UI formats may have proven harder for Microsoft than originally anticipated.
    


        
    


Overall, the combined offering remains light on trending areas such as digital worker analytics and document-focused text analytics, but this is a strong acquisition. It aligns well with Microsoft Power Automate's goals of rapid deployment, citizen development, low price points, and small-to-midsize deployments. By the way, enterprises that have licensed UI Flows will get WinAutomation at no additional cost. Although late to the market overall, the beefed-up portfolio will help stem the tide of RPA vendors targeting Microsoft apps and carve out market share from UiPath that focuses on familiarity of Microsoft tools. More broadly, WinAutomation's attended-mode support, when combined with Power Virtual Agents and other Azure cognitive services, lays a strong foundation to build the next generation of invisible robots.

3004993504,Microsoft VP Explains How Its Cloud for Healthcare Will Reshape Industry,"Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare is the first of many custom, industry-specific cloud offerings Microsoft has planned.

Microsoft revealed more about its cloud strategy this week with the rollout of Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare, its first industry-specific cloud offering.

Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare is ""the first of many"" custom cloud offerings tailored for specific industries, said Greg Moore, Microsoft's VP of health, at a Wednesday event hosted by RBC Capital Markets. Moore, who is also a medical doctor, explained how the new service will improve efficiency and overall outcomes in health care.

Shares of Microsoft  (MSFT) - Get Report rose 1.2% on Wednesday to $185.39.

Moore said that the coronavirus pandemic has fueled a rapid transition to digital health care, noting a surge in telehealth and the number of healthcare workers using Microsoft Teams and other productivity tools. Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare packages together Azure, Microsoft 365, Dynamics, and other specialized offerings for healthcare providers.

""We saw in the past few weeks 34 million healthcare interactions on Teams,"" Moore said. ""We do think the time is right to bring these things together and offer differentiated solutions.""

Microsoft highlighted its security standards in Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare. The healthcare industry has much higher compliance burdens than most, and Moore said Cloud for Healthcare makes it possible for providers to share and analyze information with HIPAA and ""enterprise-grade"" security built in.

Microsoft says it worked with a range of tech and healthcare partners, including Adaptive Biotechnologies  (ADPT) - Get Report, Allscripts  (MDRX) - Get Report, DXC Technology  (DXC) - Get Report, KPMG, Nuance  (NUAN) - Get Report, Humana  (HUM) - Get Report, Providence, Novartis  (NVS) - Get Report, and Walgreens Boots Alliance  (WBA) - Get Report, to co-develop specific solutions.

""Healthcare systems have been providing care in their communities for a century or more, and they earn that trust through relationships every day with patients,"" Moore said. ""We’re taking a humble approach here and learning from partners every day.""

Moore said that many of the custom offerings, such as a chatbot used to aid diagnoses and AI tools to generate documentation and paperwork, will help reduce burnout among healthcare providers, as well as lower costs over time. Tools like virtual appointments and chatbots are an ""affirmation of the market"" and are here to stay, he said. U.S. healthcare spending was estimated at $3.6 trillion in 2019.

""Healthcare is 18% of GPP roughly...this industry is already infused with technology, and like other industries, is making a significant move to the cloud,"" Moore said ""That’s not a part of the economy, a business that you ignore.""

In a note on Wednesday, RBC Capital Markets analyst Alex Zukin noted that healthcare initiatives are viewed as an important growth driver ""at the highest levels of the company.""

Microsoft's CEO Satya Nadella emphasized rapid changes in the healthcare industry in a video statement this week, highlighting the ways in which organizations are bringing ""together compute, data and AI speed up the response to COVID-19.""

RBC's Zukin added that Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare ""continues to underscore the synergies that the 'new' Microsoft has been able to harvest over the last few years by knocking down traditionally silo’d fiefdoms and going to market with a cohesive, cross-product strategy.""

In its March quarter earnings release, Microsoft reported 59% growth in its Azure business, as well as high engagement with its various productivity products.

3004906010,"Department of Justice, State AGs to Target Google for Antitrust Violations, WSJ Reports","By Jerri-Lynn Scofield, who has worked as a securities lawyer and a derivatives trader. She is currently writing a book about textile artisans.

The Wall Street Journal broke a story this past Friday, reporting that the Department of Justice and several state attorneys generals were about to file an antitrust case against Google, Justice Department, State Attorneys General Likely to Bring Antitrust Lawsuits Against Google.

Both the Justice Department and a group of state attorneys general are likely to file antitrust lawsuits against Alphabet Inc.’s Google—and are well into planning for litigation, according to people familiar with the matter.

The Justice Department is moving toward bringing a case as soon as this summer, some of the people said. At least some state attorneys general—led by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, a Republican—are likely to file a case, probably in the fall, people familiar with the matter said.

Much of the states’ investigation has focused on Google’s online advertising business. The company owns the dominant tool at every link in the complex chain between online publishers and advertisers. The Justice Department likewise is making Google’s ad technology one of its points of emphasis. But it is also focusing more broadly on concerns that Google uses its dominant search business to stifle competition, people familiar with the matter said.

As I posted in November about on a blockbuster WSJ investigation of Google’s search algorithm (see Blockbuster WSJ Investigation: How Google Interferes With Its Search Algorithms and Changes Your Results), I was keenly interested in this WSJ update to see what the latest state of play is

Alas, the latest WSJ account is maddeningly short on details, particularly as to the legal theories the government will seek to advance – and admitted as much:

Details about the Justice Department’s legal theories for a case against Google couldn’t be learned.

So I waited to post, hoping that more details might emerge, and that the WSJ piece might serve as a trial balloon to stimulate disclosure  -or leaking? – of further detail. Much of the subsequent coverage has regurgitated the WSJ’s claims – without significantly advancing the state of knowledge. Yes, it’s clear that if the government brings claims, it will be the first major antitrust action brought in decades since the Clinton administration went after Bill Gates’s Microsoft, joining 20 states in an action that settled in 2001, according to the New York Times, U.S. Is Said to Plan to File Antitrust Charges Against Google.

It’s by no means an original observation that we no longer have any meaningful antitrust enforcement in the United States. This started to erode with the Reagan administration – although there have been periods of prosecutorial feistiness, both state and federal. For those who’d like to know more about the subject – and how it continues to distort ourpolitical economy, you can do no  better than start with Matt Stoller’s book, Goliath: The 100 Year War Between Monopoly Power and Democracy.

By Monday, the WSJ was no closer to offering us additional insights to the legal theories the DOJ and state AGs were considering. But it did serve up a possible line to pursue, by  discussing a paper written by a former Obama antitrust official, Former Obama Antitrust Official Lays Out Possible Case Against Google:

A former top antitrust economist in the Obama administration argued Monday that Alphabet Inc.’s GOOG -0.76% Google has used its powerful position in the digital advertising space to stifle competition, outlining a possible case against the search giant at the same time federal and state enforcers are making preparations to go to court.

“There is significant reason for concern that Google has violated U.S. antitrust law,” Yale University economics professor Fiona Scott Morton, the chief economist in the Justice Department’s antitrust division from 2011-2012, wrote in a new academic paper entitled “Roadmap for a Digital Advertising Monopolization Case Against Google.”

The paper argues Google is using its dominance in search as a springboard to dominate the adjacent market of display advertising, harming publishers, advertisers and consumers in the $130 billion digital advertising market.

Now, according to a recent piece in The Verge by Casey Newton The antitrust case against Google is becoming just another partisan fight:

Morton’s analysis is based on a December report from the United Kingdom’s Competition and Markets Authority. The report “found that Google had at least 90% market share in the tools publishers use to serve ads; between 40% and 60% of the market for supply-side platforms, or SSPs, the tools publishers use to accept bids from exchanges; and between 50% and 70% of demand-side platforms, or DSPs, the tools advertisers use to bid for digital ads.” Google disputes the study’s findings.

Newton laments that antitrust is now subject to partisan calculation – and that this is some  recent development:

It would be nice if we could have a debate about Google and competition on the merits. But this is the United States and 2020, and so the debate is already tainted by partisan politics. Ken Paxton, the Texas attorney general who is leading the investigation for the attorneys general, is sending fundraising emails promoting his work. Reuters reported that one email said Texans “‘are put at risk’ by the company, ‘whose executives clearly display anti-conservative and anti-Republican bias, subtly controlling what Americans see when they search for information about national political issues.’”

Is this a problem? And is it really all that new a phenomenon?

I happen to think it’s simply wrong and misguided to assume that antitrust enforcement policy is not subject to partisan calculation. Maybe that’s because I believe most, if not all, areas or public policy are.There’s tremendous money at stake in deciding how to apply the rules of the games. In fact, one of Tom Ferguson’s seminal contributions to our political understanding is to explicate how political parties compete for political contributions, and how those contributions shape their policy positions. Ferguson has written extensively about the New Deal, among many other topics, and has mined libraries and archives for the smoking guns (see Golden Rule: The Investment Theory of Party Competition and the Logic of Money-Driven Political Systems.)

And it’s precisely in times such as these – with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic – that we expect to see intense competition over various politics and policy elements, leading perhaps to radical partisan realignment,

So, I will continue to scan the WSJ, as well as other media, intensely to see what antitrust theories the Department of Justice advances to apply to Google, as well as the various state attorney generals.

3004784978,Microsoft unveils cloud tools tailored for health care systems,"Microsoft unveiled a package of cloud software designed for health-care systems, starting with a free trial to help the industry weather a viral pandemic that is both increasing the need for technology solutions and putting hospitals in financial peril.

Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare includes tools that allow for digital triage, telemedicine and coordination of care using internet-based services, chat and conferencing apps. The product, unveiled Tuesday as part of a virtual version of the company’s annual Build conference for software developers, is Microsoft’s first industry-specific cloud-computing offering. It’s available now via a preview and free trial for the next six months.

The package combines Microsoft’s Azure cloud service – which helps organizations run programs and store and analyze data – with the Teams communication app and developer tools for creating applications.

Microsoft, the second-biggest cloud infrastructure provider behind Amazon.com Inc., has made the health-care industry a focus as it tries to gain customers. Some of the tools Microsoft has been working on for several years, including artificial intelligence and automated chat-bot software for communicating with patients, have gained traction as the Covid-19 outbreak has health-care industry customers looking for ways to track the spread of the virus, predict equipment needs and connect patients and doctors online.

“At this particular time there’s the increased demand to go virtual and have connectivity, while needing to pay attention to the bottom line so they can continue to serve,” said Greg Moore, corporate vice president of Microsoft Health. “This is a time for Microsoft to come in and help what are already our deep partners in health care.” Hospitals have been hit especially hard, with costs rising as they care for Covid-19 patients while revenue plunges because other procedures have been delayed.

Providence St. Joseph Health, a chain with hospitals in seven Western states, has used a version of Microsoft’s health-care chat bot to screen patients for Covid-19 and funnel those who need care to a provider or a telemedicine consultation, Moore said. In total more than 1,600 Covid-19 care bots are in use that rely on Microsoft’s software, largely as a tool to reduce strain on emergency hotlines. They’re deployed in 23 countries in cities from Copenhagen to Tel Aviv, including a Covid assessment bot from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Meanwhile, St. Luke’s University Health Network and parts of the U.K.’s National Health Service have used Teams chat software for telemedicine appointments. Thirty-four million health-care meetings, including appointments, were held in Teams in the four weeks ended April 25, Microsoft said.

In November, the company announced a new Bookings app in Teams to let medical providers schedule, conduct and transcribe secure virtual appointments through Microsoft’s chat and video-conferencing program. The plan was to try it out as Microsoft usually does for early-stage software – with a couple dozen key customers supervised by the software maker. Then the virus hit and demand accelerated for this kind of product, so Microsoft let some 483 hospitals and providers try the app.

“When Covid happened we weren’t quite ready to make it generally available yet but we knew there was such an imminent need,” said Kristina Behr, a general manager at Microsoft. “We felt a sense of urgency to help.”

Now the app will be released publicly, letting individual doctors’ offices or smaller practices use it. Next, the company will roll out the booking application to other industries. Already financial-services companies are trying it for appointments with advisers, and government agencies are also interested – imagine an online appointment to handle a parking ticket. In the future, Microsoft may blend the app with digital-signature capabilities for such tasks as online mortgage-signing appointments, Behr said.

At the conference, Microsoft also planned to announce other tools for software developers and new products, including:

– A set of three tool-kits for making artificial intelligence models more explainable, fair and private. The tools will be part of Azure’s machine learning service and are also available on GitHub for anyone to use. One kit, called InterpretML, helps data scientists determine why a machine learning model is drawing certain conclusions and which parameters are driving the prediction. That’s key for determining whether an AI algorithm is making decisions based on unfair or discriminatory information. A second tool-kit, called Fairlearn, helps developers understand whether the AI model is relying on data in a biased way. Ernst & Young used it to find that their automated-lending algorithm gave a 15% advantage to males. And WhiteNoise is a new feature for making data more private within AI models.

– Microsoft said it built a powerful AI supercomputer using Azure in collaboration with and for the exclusive use of OpenAI, the research group working on artificial general intelligence that Microsoft invested $1 billion in last year. The supercomputer will be used to train massive AI models.",en,neutral,0.706055,neutral,0.753128,"['health care', 'cloud', 'Microsoft']","['funnel', 'Build conference', 'Greg Moore', 'algorithm', 'health care', 'machine learning', 'Amazon.com Inc.', 'general manager', 'National Health Service', 'artificial intelligence', 'AI', 'artificial general intelligence', 'University Health Network', 'Tel Aviv', 'telemedicine', 'Microsoft', 'parking ticket', 'triage', 'viral', 'virus', 'cloud', 'Ernst & Young', 'pandemic', 'digital', 'video-conferencing', 'U.K.', 'Covid-19', 'Covid', 'supercomputer', 'GitHub', 'Providence', 'Copenhagen', 'U.K', 'Build', 'Bookings', 'Kristina Behr', '– Microsoft', 'Cloud for Healthcare', 'Azure', 'Teams', 'Amazon.com Inc', 'Microsoft Health', 'Providence St. Joseph Health', 'Moore', 'U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention', 'St. Luke’s University Health Network', 'Behr', 'InterpretML', 'WhiteNoise', 'OpenAI']","['health', 'tools', 'care', 'cloud', 'systems', 'Microsoft', 'health care', 'tools Microsoft', 'Microsoft Health', 'Microsoft’s health-care', 'software', 'appointments', 'provider', 'Health', 'models', 'data', 'company', 'health-care', 'hospitals', 'industry', 'funnel', 'Build conference', 'Greg Moore', 'algorithm', 'machine learning', 'Amazon.com Inc.', 'general manager', 'National Health Service', 'artificial intelligence', 'AI', 'artificial general intelligence', 'University Health Network', 'Tel Aviv', 'telemedicine', 'parking ticket', 'triage', 'viral', 'virus', 'Ernst & Young', 'pandemic', 'digital', 'video-conferencing', 'U.K.', 'Covid-19', 'Covid', 'supercomputer', 'GitHub', 'Providence', 'Copenhagen']","['#Microsoft', '#ArtificialIntelligence', '#AI', '#CloudComputing', '#Virus', '#Telemedicine', '#HealthCare', '#MachineLearning', '#Algorithm', '#Supercomputer', '#Pandemic', '#DigitalTerrestrialTelevision', '#Triage', '#Build', '#Amazon', '#GregMoore', '#ProvidenceRhodeIsland', '#Funnel', '#Copenhagen', '#TelAviv', '#UniversityHealthNetwork', '#UnitedKingdom', '#NationalHealthService', '#Videotelephony', '#GeneralManager', '#TrafficTicket', '#GitHub', '#ErnstYoung', '#ArtificialGeneralIntelligence']",13,33,842,5213,2020-05-20 06:23:45+00:00,The Seattle Times,"{'avatar_url': None, 'id': 1418587, 'name': 'Dina Bass'}","{'sentences': ['The package combines Microsoft’s Azure cloud service – which '

3005012603,"Huawei says its operating system can rival Google, Apple — but experts say it might be a struggle","A top Huawei executive said the Chinese company's mobile operating system is able to compete with Google and Apple — but analysts told CNBC that might be tough to achieve, especially in markets outside China where U.S. technology giants have a strong foothold. ""Huawei is in a position to deliver an ecosystem that is on par with Google's and Apple's ecosystems,"" Huawei's vice president of consumer cloud services in its consumer business, Eric Tan, said on Tuesday. ""We have the confidence to be one of the top ecosystem developers in the world.""  He was speaking about the company's own operating system, called the HarmonyOS, which was launched in August. It comes as the Chinese technology giant attempts to forge a path ahead without American technology.  Huawei's smartphones have relied on Google's Android operating system for a number of years. But in 2019, the Chinese firm was put on a U.S. blacklist which restricted its access to American technology and meant it was no longer able to use licensed Android software on its handsets. In response, Huawei launched its own operating system that same year.

On Tuesday, Huawei executives spoke about HarmonyOS, playing up its ability to be an operating system that can work across a number of devices rather than just smartphones alone, which could appeal to developers looking to make apps that work on different hardware. The management also talked about the Huawei Mobile Services (HMS), a collection of various Huawei apps from maps to payments to its app store.  Huawei's claim about being able to deliver an ecosystem ""on par"" with Google's and Apple's is a big one, considering the company only launched its operating system less than a year ago. But Tan backed up his comments by revealing that by the end of March, Huawei had 1.4 million developers on board — up 115% from the end of the first quarter of 2019.  In China, where Huawei is the biggest smartphone maker by market share, not having access to Google's Android is not a huge problem. That's because Google services, such as search, are blocked in the country and users can't really use them anyway. That also means Huawei's HarmonyOS has a chance of being successful in the domestic market.

However, in international markets where apps are built on Google's services — integrating maps or payments, for example — Huawei could find its HarmonyOS a tough sell. ""It won't be easy for Huawei to build up a library of premier applications outside of China, as many of them rely on Google for things like digital rights management, location, payment, and notification services,"" Bryan Ma, vice president of devices research at IDC, told CNBC. Huawei was not immediately available for comment when contacted by CNBC. ""Developers oftentimes have to be selective on which projects they spend their time on, and a key factor in that decision-making is whether there is enough of a critical mass in the user base to justify the time and effort spent in porting applications over,"" Ma said.

Huawei's HMS is similar to Google Mobile Services and offers developers kits that can be used to integrate things like location services into apps. The Chinese firm said there are 60,000 apps using so-called HMS Core services, but it did not break down what countries or regions those are in.  Neil Shah, research director at Counterpoint Research, called the number of apps ""limited"" and said Huawei is still missing major apps.  ""Outside of China, it will be struggle as most of the marquee applications come from big profile U.S. developers — Netflix, Facebook properties (Instagram, WhatsApp), Google apps, etc — which are obviously banned to collaborate with Huawei,"" Shah said. ""So overall, without marquee developers on board, it's going to be a tough sell."" Indeed, a number of major apps that are important in international markets are not on Huawei's app store, called the AppGallery. Users cannot download any Google apps or Facebook-owned services. Netflix or Spotify are not available either.  However, it does have the Amazon Shopping app, as well as video-sharing app TikTok, which is owned by Chinese firm ByteDance.  Huawei has expressed its desire to get Google apps onto the AppGallery. ""We hope Google services can be available through our AppGallery, just like how Google services are available through Apple's App Store,"" Eric Xu, rotating chairman at Huawei said in an interview with CNBC in March.  But this will be a challenge, according to Ma.  ""Legal considerations aside, I find it highly unlikely that Google would publish its own apps into the AppGallery, as they have the same hooks into its services as third parties do. And if anything, they want to drive usage of their services,"" he said.",en,neutral,0.9576040000000001,neutral,0.865667,"['Google', 'Apple', 'Huawei', 'operating system']","['smartphones', 'smartphone', 'Google apps', 'critical mass', 'Mobile', 'Amazon', 'App Store', 'CNBC', 'Huawei', 'Facebook', 'Instagram', 'WhatsApp', 'mobile operating system', 'Android operating system', 'Android', 'forge', 'operating system', 'digital rights management', 'market share', 'app store', 'Chinese', 'China', 'Google', 'cloud services', 'Netflix', 'Spotify', 'ecosystem', 'Apple', 'U.S', 'HarmonyOS', 'AppGallery', 'Eric Tan', 'Tan', '— Huawei', 'Bryan Ma', 'Ma', 'Neil Shah', '— Netflix', 'Eric Xu', ""Google's Android"", 'Huawei Mobile Services', 'HMS', 'IDC', 'Google Mobile Services', 'HMS Core', 'Counterpoint Research', 'Shah', 'TikTok', 'ByteDance']","['Google', 'system', 'Apple', 'operating', 'experts', 'Huawei', 'struggle', 'operating system', 'Huawei apps', 'Google services', 'Google apps', 'Chinese technology', 'services', 'apps', 'developers', 'Chinese', 'technology', 'China', 'U.S.', 'markets', 'users', 'CNBC', 'number', 'smartphones', 'smartphone', 'critical mass', 'Mobile', 'Amazon', 'App Store', 'Facebook', 'Instagram', 'WhatsApp', 'mobile operating system', 'Android operating system', 'Android', 'forge', 'digital rights management', 'market share', 'app store', 'marquee', 'cloud services', 'Netflix', 'Spotify', 'ecosystem', 'video-sharing']","['#Huawei', '#Google', '#China', '#OperatingSystem', '#AppleInc', '#CNBC', '#CNBC', '#Ecosystem', '#Smartphone', '#Android', '#GSuite', '#AppStore', '#Marquee', '#Netflix', '#MobileOperatingSystem', '#CloudComputing', '#Forge', '#MobileAlabama', '#MarketShare', '#DigitalRightsManagement', '#CriticalMass', '#Facebook', '#Instagram', '#WhatsApp', '#Spotify', '#Amazon', '#OnlineVideoPlatform', '#AppStore']",4,33,817,4733,2020-05-21 00:24:12+00:00,CNBC,"{'avatar_url': None, 'id': 984999, 'name': 'Arjun Kharpal'}","{'sentences': [""A top Huawei executive said the Chinese company's mobile ""

3004980365,No surprises here: Amazon is top e-retailer in North America,"Mass merchant and consumer electronics retailers top an annual ranking of the top 500 North American e-commerce retailers by web sales.

Amazon ranked No. 1, followed by Apple, Walmart, and Dell Technologies on the Digital Commerce 360 list. The Home Depot (No. 5) was the highest-ranked e-retailer by web sales outside the mass merchant and consumer electronics categories. The remainder of the top 10 was filled out by Wayfair, Alphabet Inc. (Google parent company), Staples, Quarate Retail Group, and Best Buy.

Digital Commerce 360 analysis indicates that the top 500 e-retailers grew their collective web sales by 16.3% in 2019 over the year before. That’s at a faster clip than the North American e-commerce market as a whole at 15.1%.

The 135 retail chains and 171 web-only retailers in the Top 500 were the standouts, growing their web sales by 17.2% and 17.8%, respectively. By merchandise category, housewares and home furnishings and sporting goods retailers led the way, growing at 22.7% and 22%, respectively. Food and beverage retailers came in third, with 21.5% growth. Office supplies retailers grew online only by 1.7%, making office supplies the slowest-growing category in the Top 500.

Overall, the vast majority of the Top 500 grew web sales: 96.2% of the top 500 increased web sales in 2019, and 56% grew sales more than the North American e-commerce market average. The 485 U.S.-based retailers in the 2020 Top 500 accounted for 88.2% of U.S. online retail sales in 2019.

The retailers analyzed in the Top 500 report represent the bulk of e-commerce in the U.S. In the U.S., e-commerce accounted for 57% of total retail sales growth in 2019, up from 30.9% in 2010. From 2010-19, total online retail sales in the U.S. increased at a compound annual growth rate of 14.9% compared to 3.8% for total retail sales.

Other interesting findings include:

 • The 38 digitally native retailers in the Top 500 collectively increased their online sales by 33.1% in 2019 – more than double the 16.3% for the overall Top 500 and the 12.6% for consumer brand manufacturers when excluding digitally native brands.

• U.S. sales on Amazon.com increased by 26.2%, when including purchases from Amazon and marketplace sellers. Those sales accounted for 37.3% of U.S. online retail sales and 59.7% of its growth.

• 32.8% of top 500 retailers’ web sales came from tablets and smartphones in 2019. The median share of online sales from mobile in 2019 for the top 500 was 39.1%. And, the median share of digital traffic from mobile was more than half at 58.3%, with nearly half (48.5%) of all digital traffic to Top 500 retailers coming from mobile devices. ",en,neutral,0.437385,positive,0.9173629999999999,"['North America', 'Amazon']","['tablets', 'smartphones', 'Office supplies', 'office supplies', 'Amazon', 'Amazon.com', 'Walmart', 'sporting goods', 'Staples', 'Alphabet Inc.', 'Best Buy', 'consumer electronics', 'The Home Depot', 'Google', 'e-commerce', 'digital', 'compound annual growth rate', 'Apple', 'U.S', 'Top 500', 'Dell Technologies', 'Digital Commerce', 'Wayfair, Alphabet Inc', 'Quarate Retail Group', 'Digital Commerce 360', 'retailers']","['Amazon', 'e-retailer', 'North', 'surprises', 'America', 'North America', 'retail sales', 'online sales', 'retailers', 'sales', 'Digital Commerce', 'categories', 'Digital', 'U.S.', 'online', 'Commerce', 'e-commerce', 'parent', 'Alphabet', 'Google', 'tablets', 'smartphones', 'Office supplies', 'office supplies', 'Amazon.com', 'Walmart', 'sporting goods', 'Staples', 'Alphabet Inc.', 'Best Buy', 'consumer electronics', 'The Home Depot', 'digital', 'Apple']","['#Ecommerce', '#Amazon', '#ConsumerElectronics', '#OfficeSupplies', '#DigitalTerrestrialTelevision', '#NoSurprises', '#NorthAmerica', '#AppleInc', '#Walmart', '#TheHomeDepot', '#AlphabetInc', '#Google', '#StaplesInc', '#BestBuy', '#SportsEquipment', '#CompoundAnnualGrowthRate', '#TabletComputer', '#Smartphone']",10,21,484,2662,2020-05-20 20:58:55+00:00,Chain Store Age,"{'avatar_url': None, 'id': 1425739, 'name': 'Dan Berthiaume'}","{'sentences': ['The 135 retail chains and 171 web-only retailers in the Top '

3004819687,Amazon will begin hiring here in about a year,"Wondering how you can apply for one of the 1,000 jobs that will be created at the huge Amazon distribution center under construction in Clay?

Amazon expects to open the $350 million, 3.8-million-square-foot center in September 2021, so you've got time. Company spokeswoman Rachael Lighty said the online re- tailer will start hiring a couple of months before the facility opens.


""So, we're about one year away from hiring,"" she said.


Anyone interested in applying for a job can sign up on the company's website to receive email alerts about available jobs.


Go to tinyurl.com/Amazon-alerts. Or text AMAZON to 77088 to receive text alerts on their smartphone about job opportunities with the company.


You can also search on the company's jobs website (amazon.jobs/en) for positions at any Amazon location around the globe. (The site will not show jobs for the Clay site for about a year, though.)


Lighty said most of the jobs in Clay will be fulfillment associate positions. Workers in those jobs will bring merchandise (books, electronics, household goods, toys and other small products) into the building, load it into storage pods, pull it from those pods to fill customer orders, package it and load it back onto a truck for shipment.


In addition, Amazon will be hiring for human resources, operations management, safety, security, finance and information technology positions.


The jobs will pay a minimum of $15 an hour. The company says full-time employees receive comprehensive benefits, including full medical, vision and dental insurance, and a 401(k) retirement plan with a 50% company match on day one. It also offers up to 20 weeks of maternal and parental paid leave.


Amazon says it will pay up to 95% of an associate's tuition for courses related to in-demand fields, regardless of whether the skills are relevant to a career at Amazon.

3004881734,Amazon back in business after virus deal with unions,"PARIS (AP) — Amazon is gradually reopening its warehouses in France after working out virus safety measures with unions, in an effort to end weeks of legal troubles that had sharply curtailed the company’s French business and drawn worldwide attention.
In a victory for labor unions, French courts ruled last month that Amazon hadn’t done enough to protect thousands of French workers from the Coronavirus. The world’s largest online retailer shut its six French warehouses as a result – just as global demand soared because stores were shuttered by virus restrictions.
After protracted negotiations, Amazon started a three-week reopening process Tuesday.

        “It’s a big victory for Amazon workers in France,” as well as for others who have complained about poor virus protections, said Stephane Enjalran, national secretary of France’s Sud Solidaire Union, which led the legal proceedings as the largest union at Amazon.
French unions have been in touch with Amazon workers in the U.S., Italy, Poland and beyond, Enjalran told The Associated Press. He expressed hope that the French court rulings could encourage them — or workers at other companies in France — to demand better virus safety.
Amazon said that all necessary measures had already been in place before the temporary shutdown, and that it has made no major changes since then. “Our sites are safe, and always have been safe,” it said in a statement.

        
Unions dispute that, saying the company took weeks to supply masks and gel to workers, and flouted the stringent French union consultation process. They say Amazon didn’t do enough to enforce social distancing, to ensure that turnstiles and personal storage areas were virus-free, or to increase cleaning of its warehouses – and two French courts agreed.
New safety measures at the French warehouses include tougher social distancing rules, monitoring by a new independent expert and sweeping changes to the logistical chain to reduce the number of people allowed to work in the same place at the same time, Enjalran said.
“The most important thing is that there is a dialogue between management and workers that didn’t happen before,” he said.
Amazon is now holding training sessions for French warehouse staff, in one small group at a time, on the virus protection measures, its France director Frederic Duval said Tuesday on public broadcaster France-Info.
Duval called the reopening “excellent news” for workers, customers and French companies that sell via Amazon. He said the company is committed to “the security of our workers” and is adapting its practices based on guidance from government health authorities. Staffers were paid while the warehouses were closed.
Unions hailed the court rulings as a comeuppance for Amazon, arguing that the company placed profits above safety as the virus spread fast around France.",en,neutral,0.5985090000000001,neutral,0.403188,"['Amazon', 'virus']","['labor unions', 'Italy', 'France', 'French', 'Amazon', 'public broadcaster', 'online retailer', 'Associated Press', 'Poland', 'virus', 'French union', 'gel', 'Coronavirus', 'Coronavirus', 'PARIS', 'U.S', 'France-Info', 'Stephane Enjalran', 'Enjalran', 'Frederic Duval', 'Duval', 'AP', 'Sud Solidaire Union', 'The Associated Press', 'Unions']","['business', 'virus', 'deal', 'Amazon', 'unions', 'French workers', 'Amazon workers', 'French warehouse', 'French warehouses', 'French union', 'company’s French', 'French', 'workers', 'warehouses', 'France', 'Enjalran', 'company', 'labor unions', 'Italy', 'public broadcaster', 'online retailer', 'Associated Press', 'Poland', 'gel', 'Coronavirus']","['#France', '#Amazon', '#Virus', '#TradeUnion', '#Coronavirus', '#OnlineShopping', '#Italy', '#Poland', '#AssociatedPress', '#Gel', '#FrenchUnion', '#PublicBroadcasting']",13,18,463,2856,2020-05-20 12:45:35+00:00,Antelope Valley Press (CA),"{'avatar_url': None, 'id': 2643339, 'name': 'Michel Spingler/ap'}","{'sentences': ['PARIS (AP) — Amazon is gradually reopening its warehouses in '

3004984092,Report: Google Lands Huge Contract with Department of Defense,"Axios reports that Google, the tech giant known for the sharp anti-Trump bias of its executives and founders and its self-admitted “shift toward censorship” in the wake of Trump’s election, has landed a massive contract to build cloud technology for the Department of Defense.

It is unclear why the Trump Administration has favored Google, with its radically leftist internal culture, which has caused it to purge politically dissident employees, hold racist events and distribute racist literature to managers, and deliberately reorder search results on YouTube to favor the anti-Trump mainstream media.

According to Axios, Google is seeking an even larger deal with the Defense Department “down the road.”

Google Cloud has landed a deal to help the Defense Department detect, protect against, and respond to cyber threats, Axios has learned. The deal, with the Defense Innovation Unit (DIU), is in the “seven figures,” Google said, declining to be more specific. Why it matters: It’s a far cry from the controversial $10 billion JEDI deal, but Google hopes the win will lead to a broader deal down the road, as the Pentagon seeks to securely work with multiple public cloud providers.

Google has deeper ties to the Democrat party than perhaps any other technology company, which is perhaps why some executives were caught on camera tearing up after Hillary Clinton failed to win the presidency in 2016.

An investigation by the Intercept found that hundreds of individuals either moved from Google to the White House or from the White House to Google during the Obama administration.

Eric Schmidt, who was executive director of Alphabet Inc during the presidential campaign, pitched himself as “head outside adviser” to the Clinton campaign in 2014, according to emails leaked by WikiLeaks. Schmidt — then still executive director of Google-parent Alphabet — was also pictured at Hillary Clinton’s NYC “victory” party wearing a badge marked “campaign staff.”

Schmidt is deeply tied to the Department of Defense, a relationship that began during the Obama administration. He is currently Chairman of the DoD’s Defense Innovation Advisory board. Schmidt’s relationship with top U.S. politicians has also paid off in New York, where Governor Andrew Cuomo has asked him to “re-imagine” the state post-coronavirus.

President Trump recently complained that Google, along with other big tech companies, is under “total control” of the Radical Left. Yet Google has little incentive to take the President’s warnings seriously, when it continues to land huge deals with his Department of Defense.

3004799816,Why Google Is Investing In Taiwan’s Tech Talent,"The Google Inc. logo displayed at a news conference in Taipei, Taiwan.
 
   
  Maurice Tsai/Bloomberg News 
  
 
Google has shown a liking for Taiwan. In 2013, the U.S. search giant opened a data center in the island. Five years later, it welcomed more than 2,000 engineers in Taiwan as part of its acquisition of the majority of HTC’s smartphone design division for $1.1 billion. In the same year, Google announced plans to hire 300 more people in Taiwan while training 5,000 students in artificial intelligence.
 
Now, Google is eyeing Taiwan again to help train more tech talent, with an eye toward advancing some of its digital tools and hiring trainees, analysts believe.
 
Google keeps coming back to Taiwan because it offers the tech giant a relatively low-cost, but highly educated space for research and development in Asia, analysts say. The island is also seen as a shelter from the U.S.-China trade dispute as well as safe from government prying into proprietary technology.
 
“Many of these reasons go back to the same issues, like security in terms of U.S.-China trade relations and using the best mix of available resource and still sort of gaining a presence and maintaining a presence in this part of Asia,” says Tony Phoo, Taipei-based senior East Asia economist at Standard Chartered.
 
 
This month, Google added Taiwan to a Ph.D. fellowship program that offers $10,000 stipends and mentoring for computer science students. Last month, Google announced that it would train 8,000 university graduates in Taiwan to increase “digital power” on the island that’s already been a hardware hub for decades, according to local media reports.
 
Those trainees, all with less than three years work experience, will join Google’s digital talent exploration program. Specifically, training through the end of this year will leave trainees with certification in Google digital marketing tools. “We’ve been investing in Taiwan’s talent for many years,” says Tina Lin, Google’s Taiwan general manager. “This year we embarked on a program to train 8,000 fresh grads to give them the kind of digital marketing skills that we’ve heard companies really need to support them in their digital transformation journey.”
 
 
Google will consider hiring some of the trainees itself, says Song Seng Wun, an economist in the private banking unit of CIMB in Singapore. “Many will be employed by Google,” he says. “The rest can still be connected back to the company in the future.”
 
Google will tap into Taiwan’s “talent pool” for product and service development while marketing digital tools to the island’s B2B and B2C customers via the training, certification and software development, forecasts Stephen Su, general director of the Industrial Economics and Knowledge Center at the Industrial Technology Research Institute in Taiwan. “Taiwan has a large base of hardware engineers and industries which can complement Google [and] which require closer integration of software and hardware,” Su says, naming AI and robotics as examples.
 
The U.S. search giant ultimately wants a relatively low-cost and secure base in Northeast Asia, says Standard Chartered’s Phoo. Costs, including labor, run higher in Japan and South Korea than in Taiwan. The island has made power supplies more stable in the past two years, he adds.
 
Taiwan already offers cheaper labor and rent while “turning out excellent engineers to feed a decades-old, globally-recognized electronics contract manufacturing industry and chip industry,” says Mark Natkin, managing director of Beijing-based IT research firm Marbridge Consulting.
 
China is not an option since Google closed its Chinese search engine in 2010 over hacking and censorship efforts. “You would probably on that front not consider China to be among the best of choices,” Phoo says.",en,neutral,0.723828,positive,0.987132,"['Google', 'Taiwan']","['Bloomberg News', 'smartphone', 'Ph.D.', 'Industrial Technology Research Institute', 'digital marketing', 'censorship', 'contract manufacturing', 'university', 'Taipei', 'general manager', 'computer science', 'East Asia', 'island', 'B2C', 'Taiwan', 'CIMB', 'division', 'artificial intelligence', 'AI', 'Asia', 'Japan', 'B2B', 'search engine', 'South Korea', 'Singapore', 'China', 'Chinese', 'Google Inc.', 'Google', 'economist', 'software development', 'digital', 'HTC', 'Northeast Asia', 'power supplies', 'Standard Chartered', 'data center', 'robotics', 'U.S', 'Beijing', 'Maurice Tsai', 'Tony Phoo', 'Tina Lin', 'Song Seng Wun', 'Stephen Su', '” Su', 'Standard Chartered’s Phoo', 'Mark Natkin', 'Phoo', 'Google Inc', 'Industrial Economics and Knowledge Center', 'Marbridge Consulting']","['Google', 'Talent', 'Tech', 'Taiwan', 'Google’s Taiwan', 'Google’s digital', 'Google digital', 'years', 'engineers', 'digital', 'island', 'Industrial', 'Asia', 'Bloomberg News', 'digital transformation', 'smartphone', 'Ph.D.', 'digital marketing', 'censorship', 'contract manufacturing', 'university', 'Taipei', 'general manager', 'computer science', 'East Asia', 'B2C', 'CIMB', 'division', 'artificial intelligence', 'AI', 'Japan', 'private banking', 'B2B', 'search engine', 'South Korea', 'Singapore', 'China', 'Chinese', 'hacking', 'complement', 'Google Inc.', 'economist', 'software development', 'HTC', 'Northeast Asia', 'power supplies', 'Standard Chartered', 'data center', 'robotics']","['#Google', '#Taiwan', '#Island', '#China', '#DigitalTerrestrialTelevision', '#ArtificialIntelligence', '#Asia', '#Economist', '#StandardChartered', '#DigitalMarketing', '#Taipei', '#BloombergNews', '#DataCenter', '#HTC', '#HTC', '#Smartphone', '#Division', '#EastAsia', '#DoctorOfPhilosophy', '#ComputerScience', '#University', '#GeneralManager', '#DigitalTransformation', '#PrivateBanking', '#CIMB', '#CIMB', '#Singapore', '#Businesstobusiness', '#Retail', '#SoftwareDevelopment', '#IndustrialTechnologyResearchInstitute', '#ShipsCompany', '#AI', '#Robotics', '#NortheastAsia', '#Japan', '#SouthKorea', '#PowerSupply', '#ContractManufacturer', '#WebSearchEngine', '#SecurityHacker', '#Censorship']",29,26,635,3813,2020-05-20 07:30:16+00:00,Forbes,"{'avatar_url': None, 'id': 1132007, 'name': 'Ralph Jennings'}","{'sentences': ['Now, Google is eyeing Taiwan again to help train more tech '

3004966551,Google and Apple launch COVID-19 Exposure Notification API for public health apps,"A month after announcing a partnership to develop smartphone-based contact-tracing technology, Google and Apple have announced that their new Exposure Notifications APIs are available for developers of public health apps.

In other words, you may soon be able to download an app that will alert you if you’ve come in contact with someone who came down with COVID-19. But the companies note that the feature will be opt-in and it will require you to install an app… which helps limit privacy concerns (see more on that below), but which also limits the effectiveness of this technology.



According to Apple and Google, the API is available for public health app developers in a handful of states in the US and in 22 countries across five continents.

The companies say they built the system with privacy in mind — the idea is that your phones can share data via Bluetooth with those of people nearby in an anonymous way. So if you later come down with COVID-19 and enter that data into an app, other people who spent time near you will receive an alert — but this all happens anonymously. Your name, location data, and other information that could be used to identify you is never shared with Apple, Google, app developers, or public health agencies.

Some health officials have criticized Apple and Google’s privacy-first approach, saying that that by not sharing more data with public health agencies, it’s of limited use. But the companies figured that building privacy protection into the system would lead increase people’s willingness to actually use it.



If enough people installed the app, this would allow users who come down with COVID-19 to notify other people they’ve come in contact with that they may want to get tested or self-quarantine in order to protect their own health and help slow the spread of the disease.

But since the app is opt-in, I suspect that only a small fraction of Android and iOS users are likely to install the app, which means it may have a limited impact on the spread of COVID-19.

If the user base is small, the number of people self-reporting their cases will likely be small as well, as will the number of people who receive notifications… but that doesn’t necessarily mean you haven’t been exposed to the coronavirus. It just means that if you’ve been in contact with anyone who later came down with COVID-19, they didn’t report it in one of the apps using the new Exposure Notifications API.

Meanwhile, many governments are also ramping up hiring of human contact tracers who can try to track down people who may have been exposed to someone who has contracted COVID-19… no app required.

3004928007,"Bill Maris, who started Google's VC arm, brings on Google walkout organizer at his new venture firm","Section 32 is one of the newer bio investment funds on the block. It was founded by the first CEO of Google Ventures, Bill Maris, who also helped start Calico, a Google project (now Alphabet company) dedicated to anti-aging technology.

Maris, who started the fund in 2017, joined up with former diagnostics executive Mike Pellini and longtime life sciences investor Steve Kafka. Section 32 pays homage to Section 31, the intelligence agency from the Star Trek universe (Maris is a big Star Trek fan).

The firm, which raised its third fund earlier in the year, is now starting to staff up.

Maris looked to Google for many of its first additions, including communications specialist Claire Stapleton, a former employee who led an employee walkout in 2018. The walkout was in response to a report in The New York Times that Google had paid a $90 million severance package to former executive Andy Rubin, despite credible allegations of sexual misconduct while at the company. (Rubin has denied all wrongdoing.)

Section 32 is also bringing on Kenzo Fong Hing, a former head of marketing for Android, as an advisor to support its marketing and communications efforts; former Google recruiter Alice Cheung as the head of talent (""anyone who is connected to tens of thousands of engineers is someone you want on your team,"" said Maris); and talent specialist Kimberly Shih, who hails from Rubin's now-shuttered start-up, Essential.

Maris' experiences at Google have helped guide some of his own thinking about the culture at Section 32, including to keep the group small enough to foster real connections within the team. Maris is a particular believer in the power of start-ups to get things done.

""When I was at Google setting up Google Ventures, I helped define this services-based venture model,"" said Maris. ""We're focusing on the areas that are most impactful, and most requested by our portfolio companies -- and it comes down to people.""

Maris has mostly kept quiet about his time at Google, but he did weigh in after the news broke that Alphabet Chief Legal Officer David Drummond had departed the company earlier this year after revelations that he'd dated an employee some years ago. At the time, Maris commented, ""We have very, very different ideas about how to treat people, and this was a long time coming.""

In a phone interview, Maris praised Stapleton for her talent and courage calling out the company's flaws, and said he enjoyed reading many of the company memos she wrote while they were both there.

""Claire is a wonderful person -- and she was successful at Google for many years, but it's undeniable the culture has changed significantly from when we both started,"" he said. ""It takes courage for someone to call out some of the things that company is doing or not doing that don't align for the values that it espouses. I have a lot of respect for that.""

He also shared that he's happy to be a sounding board for former Google employees who have similarly noticed shifts in the culture.",en,neutral,0.779284,positive,0.545009,"['Google', 'VC', 'Bill Maris', ""Google's VC""]","['CEO', 'Section 31', 'intelligence agency', 'The firm', 'Kafka', 'Android', 'Google Ventures', 'sexual misconduct', 'The New York Times', 'Google', 'sounding board', 'Star Trek', 'anti-aging', 'Kenzo', 'Calico', 'Bill Maris', 'Maris', 'Mike Pellini', 'Steve Kafka', 'Claire Stapleton', 'Andy Rubin', 'Rubin', 'Alice Cheung', 'Kimberly Shih', 'David Drummond', 'Stapleton', 'Claire', 'Kenzo Fong Hing', 'Alphabet']","['walkout', 'Google', 'organizer', 'venture', 'firm', 'Maris', 'Bill', 'VC', 'Google employees', 'company', 'Rubin', 'Times', 'talent', 'year', 'executive', 'employee', 'head', 'funds', 'culture', 'CEO', 'Section 31', 'intelligence agency', 'The firm', 'Kafka', 'severance package', 'Android', 'Google Ventures', 'life sciences', 'sexual misconduct', 'sounding board', 'Star Trek', 'anti-aging', 'Kenzo']","['#Google', '#GV', '#StarTrek', '#VC', '#VictoriaCross', '#CEO', '#ChiefExecutiveOfficer', '#LifeExtension', '#ListOfLifeSciences', '#FranzKafka', '#Section31', '#IntelligenceAgency', '#TheFirm', '#TheNewYorkTimes', '#SeverancePackage', '#SexualMisconduct', '#Kenzo', '#Android', '#SoundingBoard']",11,20,526,3012,2020-05-20 16:01:21+00:00,CNBC,"{'avatar_url': None, 'id': 1049601, 'name': 'Christina Farr'}","{'sentences': ['It was founded by the first CEO of Google Ventures, Bill '

3004908829,PBS Doc Puts Amazon's Bezos 'Front' and Center,"'Frontline' film digs deep into company's founder




Frontline, the investigative series on PBS, takes a big swing when Amazon Empire: The Rise and Reign of Jeff Bezos premieres Feb. 18. Airing Tuesdays, Frontline episodes typically run 60 to 90 minutes, but Amazon Empire goes for nearly two hours. Raney Aronson-Rath, executive producer of Frontline, said the film offers a fresh perspective on Amazon. ""We are really able to understand, from a company perspective, where Amazon is today,"" she said, ""and where it is going to be tomorrow.""

Based at WGBH Boston, Frontline debuted in 1983. Recent specials that stood out include For Sama, a look at a baby girl in Aleppo, Syria, and On the President's Orders, about the war on drugs staged by Rodrigo Duterte, president of the Philippines. ""For nearly 40 years, Frontline has represented the gold standard in investigative journalism,"" Perry Simon, PBS chief programming executive, said.

Frontline is undeniably on a hot streak. In 2018, Abacus: Small Enough to Jail was nominated for a best documentary feature Academy Award. For Sama was in the running at the Oscars earlier this month. ""It was truly one of the most moving documentaries I've ever seen,"" Simon said.

Aronson-Rath described Frontline films as ""well-told stories with very well-vetted, factual and fair journalism.""

'Prime' Time

Amazon Empire depicts Bezos as a young man, working on Wall Street and studying the nascent internet, then launching Amazon as an online book seller in 1995 and growing it into the retail colossus we intimately know today. The film also looks at Bezos's ambitious plans for space travel.

Amazon Empire acknowledges Bezos as a brilliant entrepreneur, but also wonders how the company has affected the global retail landscape and if it treats its fulfillment center staffers fairly. ""There are very serious questions at the heart of the film,"" Aronson-Rath said. ""They all deserve fair journalistic treatment.""

Bezos declined to be interviewed for the documentary, but does make several high-level employees available. ""Amazon gave us extraordinary access to its top-level executives,"" said Aronson-Rath.

She likened the project to Frontline's 2018 film The Facebook Dilemma, an examination of the social platform and its founder, Mark Zuckerberg, and their impact on society. Frontline producer James Jacoby does the bulk of the interview work in Amazon Empire. The film took a year to produce.

""An investigation of this type really needs the time to get it right,"" said Aronson-Rath.

A few years ago, PBS set out to make its biggest films available for theatrical viewing, getting a few into high-profile film festivals. ""It's something we increasingly work with our partners in PBS Distribution to do,"" said Simon.

For Sama was in theaters, but Amazon Empire will not be. The thinking at PBS is, Amazon Empire should reach as many viewers as possible, and should do so right away. ""We needed to get this out to the biggest audience right now,"" Aronson-Rath said.

Toward that end, PBS is making Amazon Empire available for streaming simultaneous to its on-air debut. The film will also be available on YouTube.

One of the main takeaways of the documentary for Aronson-Roth is just how much data Amazon is compiling on its users, and how their privacy is balanced out as users share the room with Alexa. ""It's good to be a thinking consumer,"" Aronson-Rath said.

'The Choice' is Yours

After Amazon Empire airs, Frontline film NRA Under Fire premieres in March. Further out is The Choice, which will offer investigative deep dives into President Donald Trump and the Democratic nominee for the presidency. ""It's our biggest hit every fouryears,"" said Aronson-Rath.

Jon Klein, chairman of Tapp Media andformerCNN U.S. president, calls himself a ""huge fan"" of Frontline. ""They tackle many of the stories no one else will touch, and many stories people have touched but they go way deeper,"" he said. ""They have a fraction of the budget of 60 Minutes, yet their stories are often more probing and more impactful.""

Simon said Frontline stories stand out for their unflinching investigative work, and the innovative way the films are delivered to viewers. Aronson-Rath echoed that sentiment. ""We are filmmakers and journalists,"" she said. •",en,neutral,0.758714,positive,0.673031,"['Amazon', 'PBS', 'PBS Doc', ""Bezos 'Front"", 'Center']","['society', 'Mark Zuckerberg', 'entrepreneur', 'journalism', 'Wall Street', 'Amazon', 'Philippines', 'Syria', '60 Minutes', 'Facebook', 'Rodrigo Duterte', 'Jeff Bezos', 'NRA', 'Frontline', 'PBS', 'Donald Trump', 'Sama', 'investigative journalism', 'Academy Award', 'Oscars', 'privacy', 'swing', 'war', 'Time', 'YouTube', 'Aleppo', 'President', 'U.S. president', 'Alexa', 'WGBH Boston', 'space travel', 'gold standard', 'Amazon Empire', 'U.S', 'Raney Aronson-Rath', 'Perry Simon', 'Jail', 'Simon', 'Aronson-Rath', 'Bezos', 'James Jacoby', 'Toward', 'Aronson-Roth', 'Yours', 'Jon Klein', 'Airing Tuesdays', 'PBS Distribution', 'The Choice', 'Tapp Media']","['Bezos', 'Front', 'Center', 'Amazon', 'PBS', 'Amazon Empire', 'Frontline', 'film', 'Aronson-Rath', 'Empire', 'President', 'documentary', 'investigative', 'Simon', 'Sama', 'executive', 'retail', 'stories', 'society', 'Mark Zuckerberg', 'executive producer', 'entrepreneur', 'journalism', 'Wall Street', 'Philippines', 'Syria', '60 Minutes', 'Facebook', 'Rodrigo Duterte', 'Jeff Bezos', 'NRA', 'Donald Trump', 'investigative journalism', 'Academy Award', 'Oscars', 'privacy', 'swing', 'war', 'Time', 'YouTube', 'Aleppo', 'U.S. president', 'Alexa', 'WGBH Boston', 'space travel', 'gold standard']","['#Amazon', '#Frontline', '#PBS', '#PBS', '#SamaBajau', '#PresidentOfTheUnitedStates', '#AcademyAwards', '#SwingMusic', '#JeffBezos', '#ExecutiveProducer', '#WGBHTV', '#Aleppo', '#Syria', '#WorldWarII', '#RodrigoDuterte', '#Philippines', '#GoldStandard', '#InvestigativeJournalism', '#Journalism', '#Time', '#WallStreet', '#Spaceflight', '#Entrepreneurship', '#Facebook', '#MarkZuckerberg', '#Society', '#YouTube', '#Privacy', '#AlexaInternet', '#NRA', '#NationalRifleAssociation', '#DonaldTrump', '#60Minutes']",19,42,732,4296,2020-05-20 14:28:40+00:00,Broadcasting & Cable,"{'avatar_url': None, 'id': 951538, 'name': 'Michael Malone'}","{'sentences': [""'Frontline' film digs deep into company's founder\n""

                Apple, Google release technology for pandemic apps

                
                
                
                    
                

            

        

    



                                    

                                
            Apple and Google on Wednesday released long-awaited smartphone technology to automatically notify people if they might have been exposed to the coronavirus.


    
            The companies said 22 countries and several U.S. states are already planning to build voluntary phone apps using their software. It relies on Bluetooth wireless technology to detect when someone who downloaded the app has spent time near another app user who later tests positive for the virus.


    
                                

            
            Many governments have already tried, mostly unsuccessfully, to roll out their own phone apps to fight the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. Many of those apps have encountered technical problems on Apple and Android phones and haven't been widely adopted. They often use GPS to track people’s location, which Apple and Google are banning from their new tool because of privacy and accuracy concerns.


    
                                
                    
            
                                

            
            Public health agencies from Germany to the states of Alabama and South Carolina have been waiting to use the Apple-Google model, while other governments have said the tech giants' privacy restrictions will be a hindrance because public health workers will have no access to the data.


    
                                            
                    
            The companies said they're not trying to replace contact tracing, a pillar of infection control that involves trained public health workers reaching out to people who may have been exposed to an infected person. But they said their automatic “exposure notification” system can augment that process and slow the spread of COVID-19 by virus carriers who are interacting with strangers and aren't yet showing symptoms.


    
                                
                    
            
                                
                    
            
            The identity of app users will be protected by encryption and anonymous identifier beacons that change frequently.


    
            “User adoption is key to success and we believe that these strong privacy protections are also the best way to encourage use of these apps,” the companies said in a joint statement Wednesday.


    
            The companies said the new technology — the product of a rare partnership between the rival tech giants — solves some of the main technical challenges that governments have had in building Bluetooth-based apps. It will make it easier for iPhones and Android phones to detect each other, work across national and regional borders and fix some of the problems that led previous apps to quickly drain a phone’s battery.


    
                                

            
            The statement Wednesday also included remarks from state officials in North Dakota, Alabama and South Carolina signaling that they plan to use it.


    
            ""We invite other states to join us in leveraging smartphone technologies to strengthen existing contact tracing efforts, which are critical to getting communities and economies back up and running,” said North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, a Republican.


    
            North Dakota had already launched a location-tracking app that about 4% of state residents are using, higher than other U.S. states with similar apps but falling far short of the participation rate that experts say is needed to make such technology useful.


    
            Tim Brookins, the CEO of ProudCrowd, a startup that developed North Dakota's app, said Wednesday that North Dakotans will now be asked to download two complementary apps — his model, to help public health workers track where COVID-19 patients have been, and the Apple-Google model, to privately notify people who might have been exposed to the virus.",en,neutral,0.585249,neutral,0.6073890000000001,"['Google', 'Apple']","['North Dakota', 'smartphone', 'CEO', 'Bluetooth', 'Alabama', 'infection control', 'encryption', 'GPS', 'wireless', 'Android', 'Public health', 'public health', 'Republican', 'battery', 'privacy', 'virus', 'Google', 'pandemic', 'Germany', 'COVID-19', 'EDT', 'coronavirus', 'South Carolina', 'Apple', 'U.S', 'iPhones', ""Matt O'brien"", 'Doug Burgum', 'Tim Brookins', 'Ap Technology Writer', 'AP', 'ProudCrowd']","['technology', 'release', 'pandemic', 'Google', 'Apple', 'apps', 'phone apps', 'North Dakota', 'public health', 'Public health', 'phone', 'North', 'user', 'Dakota', 'companies', 'governments', 'health', 'Public', 'privacy', 'people', 'Wednesday', 'COVID-19', 'smartphone', 'CEO', 'Bluetooth', 'Alabama', 'infection control', 'encryption', 'GPS', 'wireless', 'Android', 'Republican', 'battery', 'virus', 'Germany', 'coronavirus', 'EDT', 'South Carolina']","['#AppleInc', '#Google', '#Smartphone', '#Pandemic', '#PublicHealth', '#NorthDakota', '#Coronavirus', '#Virus', '#Privacy', '#Android', '#Alabama', '#SouthCarolina', '#EDT', '#EasternTimeZone', '#Bluetooth', '#Wireless', '#GPS', '#GlobalPositioningSystem', '#Germany', '#InfectionControl', '#Encryption', '#Battery', '#RepublicanParty', '#CEO', '#ChiefExecutiveOfficer']",125,23,722,7363,2020-05-20 18:13:38+00:00,Connecticut Post,"{'avatar_url': None, 'id': 1281353, 'name': ""By Matt O'brien""}","{'sentences': ['Apple, Google release technology for pandemic apps\n'

Public health departments, not Apple and Google, built the applications.

Apple and Google are getting into the digital contact tracing space, the companies jointly announced Wednesday.


Together, the tech giants rolled out a COVID-19 exposure notification system, essentially a unified programming interface that will allow public health departments to create their own contact tracing applications.


Apple and Google are not building contact tracing apps.

""Starting today, our Exposure Notifications technology is available to public health agencies on both iOS and Android,"" Apple and Google said in a statement.


""Today, this technology is in the hands of public health agencies across the world who will take the lead and we will continue to support their efforts.""

After an individual downloads and enables a contact tracing application on his phone, he would subsequently receive an alert if he is exposed to anyone who is diagnosed with or likely to have COVID-19. Of course, that assumes that the COVID-19-positive individual also has the application enabled on his phone.


The companies said that digital contact tracing is meant to argument traditional human-to-human tracing, not replace it. Digital contact tracing is faster than traditional tracing, requires fewer resources and since it doesn't rely on human memory, can make it easier to track exposure in crowded spaces, or contact with strangers.

On the other hand, for such applications to be effective, they require users to download and enable the applications on their phones, and it's not yet clear that Americans will be willing to do so en masse.


One model, by the University of Oxford, found that for digital contact tracing to be effective, 60% of the population would have to opt in. Lower adoption rates could still have a positive effect, the researchers noted.

To reach such a high level of participation, Americans will need to trust that their private health data will be protected, something technology companies that collect health data, including 23andMe, AncestryDNA and MyHeritage, have struggled with in recent years.


There's also a question of how applications will verify positive COVID-19 tests, and guard against people flooding the system with false diagnoses. (Google and Apple say verifying diagnoses will be left up to individual health authorities to decide how to address.) From a practical standpoint, the apps, which require Bluetooth, have to avoid draining users' battery life if public health departments are expecting Americans to use them.

Apple and Google got input from public health associations, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, nonprofits, government officials, academics and privacy experts in order to address some of those concerns, the companies said.


Working together to design the system means that Android and iPhone applications, as well as applications from different states, will be able to recognize one another.


Once they download the app, users will have to consent to make their information available to the health authorities and can turn it on and off when they choose to. Data collection will be kept private and only used by health authorities for COVID-19 exposure, not stored in a central database.


Both Apple and Google said that they will not monetize the data that comes out of the exposure notification system.

3004869912,2bPrecise honored as recipient of the 2020 Microsoft Health Innovation Awards,"Precision medicine platform delivers innovative clinical-genomic workflow that providers can leverage at the point of care


    CHICAGO & PITTSBURGH--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
2bPrecise™ Precision Health™ platform has been named a recipient of Microsoft Corp.’s 2020 Health Innovation Awards, in the category of “Reimagine Healthcare.”

This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200520005085/en/


The awards recognize health organizations and their technology solution partners for using Microsoft’s technology solutions in innovative ways that help enable personalized care, empower care teams, improve operational outcomes, protect health information and ultimately reimagine healthcare. The 2020 winners are impacting the industry by creating breakthrough solutions that empower health and life sciences organizations, while meeting global, local and industry-specific compliance and security standards.



A wholly owned subsidiary of Allscripts (NASDAQ: MDRX), 2bPrecise consumes genetic/genomic data from molecular labs and clinical information from EHRs. It synthesizes these elements into a clinical-genomic ontology and brings the resulting insights into the provider’s workflow.



The award nomination featured the precision-medicine success achieved by Murfreesboro Medical Clinic and SurgiCenter in Tennessee (MMC) for its use of pharmacogenomic (PGx) test results at the point of care. Shortly after implementing 2bPrecise, MMC providers analyzed PGx results for a select group of patients who were not responding as well to their psychiatric medications as anticipated. Testing revealed a potential drug-gene interaction in a significant number of these patients. Because PGx insights were available within their workflow, clinicians reevaluated their care plans and wrote new prescriptions for 87% of the patients – with 100% of these individuals then reporting marked improvement in their condition.



Assaf Halevy, co-founder and CEO of 2bPrecise, said he and his team are gratified by the Microsoft award. “It is especially meaningful that we were recognized in the ‘reimagine healthcare’ category. That is precisely what we are trying to do – and we are honored to work with innovators like MMC that display such dedication to improving the quality of care.”



Allscripts established 2bPrecise in 2016, charging the company’s leaders with developing a lab- and EHR-agnostic solution that would help the industry bridge the chasm between scientific advances in genetics and genomics, and their practical application at the point of care.



“Precision medicine is quickly becoming the new standard of care,” said Rick Poulton, President and CFO of Allscripts. “Genetic and genomic information, however, represent an entirely new dataset that needs to be integrated with the provider’s every-day workflow. We are committed to enabling clinicians at any organization – ambulatory or inpatient, academic or community-based – to be able to access and use these insights in a timely manner.”



“During this both challenging and transformational time in the healthcare industry, organizations are using technology to profoundly impact how they deliver care, evolve business operations and help people,” said Patty Obermaier, Microsoft Vice President of U.S. Health and Life Sciences. “This year’s Microsoft Health Innovation Award recipients are advancing the goals of improved patient engagement and care coordination through their innovative use of Microsoft devices, platforms and cloud and AI services.”



Nominations were submitted by health providers, payers, pharmaceutical and life science organizations, and public and private health institutions across the world for applying Microsoft technology to create transformative and highly effective innovations. An esteemed panel of industry experts selected this year’s winners based on how their innovations represented a forward-thinking development or implementation of a solution that is delivering groundbreaking results and producing better health outcomes for more people. Recipients will be highlighted on the Microsoft in Health blog at www.Microsoft.com/Health

3004871159,2bPrecise honored as recipient of the 2020 Microsoft Health Innovation Awards,"CHICAGO & PITTSBURGH--(BUSINESS WIRE)--2bPrecise™ Precision Health™ platform has been named a recipient of Microsoft Corp.’s 2020 Health Innovation Awards, in the category of “Reimagine Healthcare.”

The awards recognize health organizations and their technology solution partners for using Microsoft’s technology solutions in innovative ways that help enable personalized care, empower care teams, improve operational outcomes, protect health information and ultimately reimagine healthcare. The 2020 winners are impacting the industry by creating breakthrough solutions that empower health and life sciences organizations, while meeting global, local and industry-specific compliance and security standards.

A wholly owned subsidiary of Allscripts (NASDAQ: MDRX), 2bPrecise consumes genetic/genomic data from molecular labs and clinical information from EHRs. It synthesizes these elements into a clinical-genomic ontology and brings the resulting insights into the provider’s workflow.

The award nomination featured the precision-medicine success achieved by Murfreesboro Medical Clinic and SurgiCenter in Tennessee (MMC) for its use of pharmacogenomic (PGx) test results at the point of care. Shortly after implementing 2bPrecise, MMC providers analyzed PGx results for a select group of patients who were not responding as well to their psychiatric medications as anticipated. Testing revealed a potential drug-gene interaction in a significant number of these patients. Because PGx insights were available within their workflow, clinicians reevaluated their care plans and wrote new prescriptions for 87% of the patients – with 100% of these individuals then reporting marked improvement in their condition.

Assaf Halevy, co-founder and CEO of 2bPrecise, said he and his team are gratified by the Microsoft award. “It is especially meaningful that we were recognized in the ‘reimagine healthcare’ category. That is precisely what we are trying to do – and we are honored to work with innovators like MMC that display such dedication to improving the quality of care.”

Allscripts established 2bPrecise in 2016, charging the company’s leaders with developing a lab- and EHR-agnostic solution that would help the industry bridge the chasm between scientific advances in genetics and genomics, and their practical application at the point of care.

“Precision medicine is quickly becoming the new standard of care,” said Rick Poulton, President and CFO of Allscripts. “Genetic and genomic information, however, represent an entirely new dataset that needs to be integrated with the provider’s every-day workflow. We are committed to enabling clinicians at any organization – ambulatory or inpatient, academic or community-based – to be able to access and use these insights in a timely manner.”

“During this both challenging and transformational time in the healthcare industry, organizations are using technology to profoundly impact how they deliver care, evolve business operations and help people,” said Patty Obermaier, Microsoft Vice President of U.S. Health and Life Sciences. “This year’s Microsoft Health Innovation Award recipients are advancing the goals of improved patient engagement and care coordination through their innovative use of Microsoft devices, platforms and cloud and AI services.”

Nominations were submitted by health providers, payers, pharmaceutical and life science organizations, and public and private health institutions across the world for applying Microsoft technology to create transformative and highly effective innovations. An esteemed panel of industry experts selected this year’s winners based on how their innovations represented a forward-thinking development or implementation of a solution that is delivering groundbreaking results and producing better health outcomes for more people. Recipients will be highlighted on the Microsoft in Health blog at www.Microsoft.com/Health

The cloud-based 2bPrecise platform consumes genetic/genomic data from molecular labs and clinical information from EHRs, synthesizing them into a clinical-genomic ontology.

3004980046,Hunt. Level. Adapt. Amazon Games Launches Crucible,"SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--(NASDAQ: AMZN): Crucible, the free-to-play competitive team-based shooter from Relentless Studios, an Amazon Games development studio, is now available to download for PC. In Crucible, players work with teammates to hunt their opponents and take down hostile creatures on a lush rogue planet in pursuit of Essence, a valuable resource that amplifies hunters’ powers.

At launch, players can choose from a diverse roster of 10 hunters, including Earl, an interstellar trucker, Summer, a dual-flame-thrower-wielding former welder, and Bugg, a robot botanist. Each hunter in Crucible has their own unique weapons and abilities, and as they defeat opponents and the planet’s flora and fauna, they level up, gaining strength and enhancing their abilities. Crucible’s fast-paced combat challenges players to constantly re-evaluate and adjust their strategies, adapting to their opponents’ moves and the deadly planet itself.

“I knew Crucible was something special the very first time I played it, and it somehow keeps getting even better,” said Twitch creator Sasslyn. “The hunters are unique, but welcomingly familiar. Whether you want to stick to one or be a jack-of-all-trades, there is a hunter that will fit your preferred style of play. Throughout Crucible’s development, I’ve had the pleasure of seeing first-hand how much the team cares about their players, and the way they take feedback and use it to make Crucible into an even more innovative and unique game.”

""One thing that separates Crucible is the diversity in its characters,” said Twitch creator Bartonologist. “There's something there for everyone. Each character approaches the game differently and matches up against the other hunters in a unique way. Brings a whole new level of strategy and competition to this world.”

“The three game modes in Crucible represent three completely different kinds of teamwork required to come out on top,” said Twitch creator Stevo. “There's unlimited ways you can strategize and compose your team to win, but of course, you never know what your opposition will do either!”

Crucible begins an 8-week Pre-Season today. During this period, players can learn the game, discover and build skill playing their favorite hunters, and begin honing their strategy before Season 1 kicks off. Players who log into Crucible by June 2 will get an early adopter gift of 1,000 Credits deposited into their in-game account. Credits can be redeemed for cosmetic in-game items like skins and emotes, as well as a Pre-Season Battle Pass, available for 950 Credits. The Pre-Season Battle Pass offers players a series of challenges and rewards, including hunter and account customization options.

“As players around the world enter Crucible for the first time today, we’re eager to see how they adapt their strategies to hunt and survive in a constantly changing world,” said Christoph Hartmann, vice president at Amazon Games. “Each new match in Crucible requires fast thinking and quick adaptation to tackle each challenge that comes their way.”

Crucible is available for free on PC via Steam. Founder’s Pack bundles, featuring exclusive skins, customization items like in-game decals, and in-game currency, are available for purchase at Amazon or on Steam.

Crucible was developed by Relentless Studios, an Amazon Games development studio located in Seattle. The studio is led by Louis Castle, co-founder of Westwood Studios, and includes industry veterans with previous experience at companies including Activision Blizzard, ArenaNet, and Electronic Arts. The launch of Crucible will be followed by the release of New World from Amazon Games on August 25, 2020.

3005002948,‘Way Too Late’: Inside Amazon’s Biggest Outbreak,"Therese Kelly arrived for her shift at an Amazon warehouse March 27 to find her co-workers standing clustered in the cavernous space. They were awaiting a buildingwide announcement, a rarity at the complex known as AVP1.

Over a loudspeaker, a manager told them what they had feared: For the first time, an employee had tested positive for the coronavirus.

Some of the workers cut short their shifts and went home. Kelly, 63, got to work, one of the hundreds of thousands of Amazon employees dealing with the spike in online orders from millions of Americans quarantined at home.

In the less than two months since then, the warehouse has become Amazon’s biggest COVID-19 hot spot. More employees at AVP1, located in the Humboldt Industrial Park in Hazle Twp., have been infected by the coronavirus than at any of Amazon’s roughly 500 other facilities in the United States.

Local lawmakers believe that more than 100 workers have contracted the disease, but the exact number is unknown. At first, Amazon told workers about each new case. But when the total reached about 60, the announcements stopped giving specific numbers.

The disclosures also stopped at other Amazon warehouses. The best estimate is that more than 900 of the company’s 400,000 blue-collar workers have had the disease. But that number, crowdsourced by Jana Jumpp, an Amazon worker, almost certainly understates the spread of the illness among Amazon’s employees.

Amazon saw the pandemic up close before many American companies. In early February, it fretted about its global supply chain and consulted an infectious-disease specialist. Based in Seattle, an early epicenter of the outbreak, the company told its 50,000 employees there to work from home starting March 5.

About that time, Amazon was hit by a massive wave of orders, a surprise surge the likes of which it had never experienced. Jeff Bezos, the company’s founder and chief executive, called it “the hardest time we’ve ever faced.” The company paid workers extra to stay on the job and announced that it would hire 175,000 more to fill orders. Bezos told investors that pay increases, safety measures and testing efforts would cost more than $4 billion this quarter.

Still, toilet paper and jigsaw puzzles almost vanished from the site, and the 100 million American households that are Prime members watched Amazon struggle.

At the 600,000-square-foot warehouse where Kelly worked in Hazle Twp., products shipped from China and elsewhere are removed from trucks and broken down into smaller packages that are trucked to Amazon’s other facilities for shipment to shoppers.

Safety measures began arriving at the warehouse in mid-March, but they were introduced without rigor.

When a team that oversaw safety protocols posed for a photo March 17, wearing green for St. Patrick’s Day, its members stood right next to one another, without social distancing. Yellow tape marked off 6-foot increments on a main walkway, but many people worked much closer together, Kelly said, “just like every other day.”

On April 1, Kelly, who had worked at the warehouse for nine years, noticed that four hand sanitizer pumps affixed to a pole were empty. Later that day, feeling ill with a scratchy throat, she left work early. She tested positive for COVID-19 a few days later.

It wasn’t until the first week in April, about a month after white-collar workers in Seattle were sent home, that fever checks were instituted at the Hazle Twp. warehouse. Masks were available to those who asked for them, but weren’t required. Tables in the break room were moved apart, but as employees who had stayed home returned to work, lunch became crowded. Amazon added an extra break time on April 21 after workers complained. In social media posts and interviews, workers argued that the plant should be temporarily closed for deep cleaning.

By the end of March, state Rep. Tarah Toohil, a Republican whose district includes the warehouse, was hearing from workers. A relative of an employee called to say Amazon’s cleaning crew had not shown up for work the previous day. Two days later, the mother of a contract worker called to say not enough had changed at the warehouse.

“Now they are up to about nine cases, and it’s still running the same,” the woman wrote in an email.

Amazon kept alerting workers to new infections. April 4: four cases. April 6: nine cases. April 8: eight cases.

That day, a worker complained to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, reporting that “there’s no disinfectant, we bring our own,” and that employees awaiting COVID-19 test results were still going to work.

“The richest company in the world can afford to close for a few days with pay for their people,” the employee wrote. OSHA, which asked employers to investigate themselves during the outbreak, closed the complaint after Amazon provided documentation of its efforts.

On April 10, Amazon announced 11 new cases. On April 13, it was four new infections, and on April 15 the company told employees that another 11 people were infected. After that, no specifics were forthcoming, just announcements that there had been additional cases.

On a whiteboard in the warehouse, several employees asked managers why the number of infections was no longer shared. They were told that it made no difference and that the company didn’t want to make employees fearful.

In the dark early morning of April 11, trucks from a pest control company pulled into the facility’s parking lot. A team in hazmat suits wearing respirators sprayed disinfectant fog in the building between shifts.

There were other safety improvements. Where two people once had moved a stack of 10 empty pallets, one person instead moved five at a time. Managers told workers to tip and slide heavy items instead of lifting them with another person. Masks were required.

Still, by late April, a few places could still be too congested for employees to feel safe. One worker told colleagues in a Facebook group that social distancing was practiced everywhere but the busy area near the loading docks known as End of Line. Another wrote that she had seen 25 people working face to face across pallets, grabbing products to prepare for shipments.

“If anyone is going to get infected, it’s going to be from tonight,” she wrote in a Facebook post. She later said she had told a manager, who spaced people out more.

Since Kelly returned to work in late April, she has often worked almost 11-hour shifts - overtime to make up for some lost pay while she was out sick.

She said she was glad to see some work stations had been removed while she was away, because they had been too close together. And some workers had been hired just to refill all the sanitizer bottles.

“It’s just way too late,” she said.

As neighboring Hazleton, at the intersection of two interstates, became a hot spot for the virus, there was increasing pressure on the area’s big employers to shut down. In a few days, more than 1,500 people signed a Change.org petition calling for Amazon to close AVP1. The petition said social distancing at the facility was nearly impossible.

The local congressman, Matt Cartwright, a Democrat, held an online news conference and announced that he had asked OSHA to investigate three of the area’s major employers, because he had heard about problems with social distancing and the lack of protective gear. He later confirmed that one was Amazon. Toohil called on large industrial employers, including Amazon, to close and pay employees.

Pressure mounted when the Cargill meatpacking plant in the same industrial park as Amazon shut its doors, promising to pay its 900 workers for two weeks. More than 100 had tested positive for the disease.

“I believe it actually saved lives,” said Wendell Young IV, who heads the region’s United Food and Commercial Workers union. “Any spread related to the plant stopped immediately.”

Dave Clark, who runs Amazon’s global operations, said in a statement that “we were earlier than most when rolling out broad protective measures for our teams, and we’ve adapted every day to make improvements.” He pointed out that the warehouse is in a region with a high community infection rate and said he didn’t think employees had caught the virus at work.

“We believe our efforts are working,” Clark said.

But workers and community leaders began worrying early on that Amazon wasn’t doing enough.

The company in February began consulting with Dr. Ian Lipkin, an infectious-disease specialist at Columbia University, who advised introducing checks for fever, social distancing and other measures.

“They wanted to stay ahead of the science as best they could,” Lipkin said.

Still, some standard safety advice didn’t become common practice at AVP1 for almost two months, according to interviews with six workers, community advocates and elected officials, some of whom asked that their names not be used for fear of retribution.",en,negative,0.521153,negative,0.977499,['Amazon'],"['Cargill', 'Columbia University', 'stack', 'Dave Clark', 'toilet paper', 'Seattle', 'Amazon', 'OSHA', 'Change.org', 'infection', 'United States', 'Facebook', 'disinfectant', 'fog', 'Jeff Bezos', 'blue-collar', 'pest control', 'loudspeaker', 'fever', 'epicenter', 'meatpacking', 'supply chain', 'overtime', 'Republican', 'hazmat suits', 'social media', 'hand sanitizer', 'Hazleton', 'China', 'virus', 'district', 'pandemic', 'jigsaw puzzles', 'COVID-19', 'crowdsourced', 'coronavirus', 'Democrat', 'white-collar', 'AVP1', 'Humboldt Industrial Park', 'Hazle Twp', 'St. Patrick', 'Therese Kelly', 'Kelly', 'Jana Jumpp', 'Bezos', 'Tarah Toohil', 'Matt Cartwright', 'Toohil', 'Clark', 'Ian Lipkin', 'Lipkin', 'Occupational Safety and Health Administration', 'Wendell Young IV', 'United Food and Commercial Workers']","['Late', 'Amazon', 'Outbreak', 'Amazon worker', 'Amazon employees', 'Amazon warehouse', 'Amazon warehouses', 'workers', 'employee', 'social distancing', 'warehouse', 'company', 'safety', 'April', 'social', 'Cargill', 'Columbia University', 'stack', 'Dave Clark', 'toilet paper', 'Seattle', 'OSHA', 'Change.org', 'infection', 'United States', 'Facebook', 'disinfectant', 'fog', 'Jeff Bezos', 'blue-collar', 'pest control', 'loudspeaker', 'fever', 'epicenter', 'meatpacking', 'supply chain', 'overtime', 'whiteboard', 'Republican', 'industrial park', 'hazmat suits', 'social media', 'hand sanitizer', 'Hazleton', 'China', 'virus', 'district', 'pandemic', 'jigsaw puzzles', 'coronavirus', 'COVID-19', 'crowdsourced', 'manager', 'Democrat', 'white-collar']","['#Amazon', '#Manager', '#Coronavirus', '#Seattle', '#Fever', '#Disinfectant', '#OSHA', '#OccupationalSafetyAndHealthAdministration', '#Facebook', '#Virus', '#Loudspeaker', '#UnitedStates', '#BluecollarWorker', '#Crowdsourcing', '#Pandemic', '#SupplyChain', '#Epicenter', '#JeffBezos', '#ToiletPaper', '#JigsawPuzzle', '#China', '#HandSanitizer', '#WhitecollarWorker', '#SocialMedia', '#RepublicanParty', '#District', '#Whiteboard', '#PestControl', '#HazmatSuit', '#Fog', '#Stack', '#Overtime', '#HazletonPennsylvania', '#Changeorg', '#DemocraticParty', '#Cargill', '#MeatPackingIndustry', '#IndustrialPark', '#DaveClark', '#Infection', '#ColumbiaUniversity']",38,82,1530,8951,2020-05-20 23:18:03+00:00,"Standard-Speaker (Hazleton, PA)","{'avatar_url': None, 'id': 2646300, 'name': 'Karen Weise'}","{'sentences': ['More employees at AVP1, located in the Humboldt Industrial '

3004924300,Former GM plant site to become Amazon fulfillment center,"An e-tail giant will open its third supply chain facility in Delaware.

Amazon will launch a new, state-of-the-art fulfillment center in Wilmington, Del., creating more than 1,000 full-time jobs. The company will lease a built-to-suit building, developed by Dermody Properties, at the site of the former General Motors Wilmington assembly plant, which closed in 2009 and was demolished in 2019.

Amazon’s new operations facility will span more than 820,000-sq.-ft. on the ground floor. Employees at the site will work alongside Amazon robotics technology to pick, pack and ship smaller customer items such as books, electronics, small household goods and toys. In addition, Amazon will hire for roles in HR, operations management, safety, security, finance, and IT.

Amazon initiated operations in Delaware in New Castle in 1997, and opened its second Delaware fulfillment center in Middletown in 2012.

""The First State was home to Amazon's first fulfillment center 23 years ago,"" said Ryan Smith, director of Amazon robotics fulfillment centers in North America. ""I'm proud to see the continued growth and investment in Delaware with our newest fulfillment center in Wilmington. Amazon has found an outstanding, passionate workforce, strong state and local support and incredible customers across the state. We look forward to creating 1,000 new, full-time jobs with industry-leading pay and benefits, starting on day one, in a safe, innovative and quality work environment.""

Since 2010, Amazon says it has invested more than $2.5 billion in Delaware through its customer fulfillment infrastructure and employee compensation. Amazon's says its investments in Delaware have contributed an additional $1 billion into the state's economy, and using methodology developed by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, Amazon estimates its investments in the state have created an additional 700-plus indirect jobs on top of the company's 2,500 direct hires.

3004947783,Apple and Google launch coronavirus exposure software,"Apple and Google said some U.S. states and 22 countries would be using the software, but the companies declined to provide a list of all the government agencies using it.

Apple and Google provided endorsements of the software from officials in three U.S. states, such as Doug Burgum, governor of North Dakota. “North Dakota is excited to be among the first states in the nation to utilize the exposure notification technology built by Apple and Google to help keep our citizens safe,” he wrote in a statement provided by the two companies.

The software has come under criticism recently because some public health authorities say it doesn’t provide the data necessary for them to improve their own contact tracing efforts, which is being conducted by armies of real people conducting interviews with covid-19 patients.

The purpose of contact tracing interviews is to help public health authorities trace the spread of the virus so that they can take actions to slow it. Some public health authorities would like to use the data to help jog people’s memories, because they may not remember everywhere they’ve been or who they might have contacted.

In that effort, some government agencies were working on their own apps, even before Google and Apple announced they were working on the software on April 10. But those apps didn’t work properly because of restrictions the companies place on smartphones and because the phones running Google and Apple software don’t communicate well enough with each other.

Some public health officials had asked Apple to remove some of those restrictions, but Apple declined, citing privacy and battery life issues.

As an alternative, Apple and Google created their own software, which removed some of the barriers public health authorities had wanted to remove, but placed new restrictions, limiting how public health authorities could use the data. For instance, a coronavirus patient being interviewed by public health officials cannot provide a list of people they may have contacted via bluetooth.",en,neutral,0.687686,negative,0.65315,"['Google', 'Apple']","['North Dakota', 'smartphones', 'bluetooth', 'battery', 'real people', 'public health', 'privacy', 'virus', 'Google', 'covid-19', 'coronavirus', 'Apple', 'U.S', 'Doug Burgum']","['launch', 'coronavirus', 'exposure', 'Google', 'Apple', 'software', 'public', 'health', 'companies', 'officials', 'people', 'authorities', 'restrictions', 'contact', 'U.S.', 'interviews', 'North Dakota', 'smartphones', 'bluetooth', 'battery', 'real people', 'public health', 'privacy', 'virus', 'covid-19']","['#AppleInc', '#Google', '#PublicHealth', '#Coronavirus', '#NorthDakota', '#RealPeople', '#Virus', '#Smartphone', '#Privacy', '#ArtilleryBattery', '#Bluetooth']",7,11,337,2040,2020-05-20 17:39:42+00:00,The Washington Post,"{'avatar_url': None, 'id': 1398503, 'name': 'Reed Albergotti'}","{'sentences': ['Apple and Google said some U.S. states and 22 countries would '

3005006769,Ecobank Teams With Google To Help African SMBs,"The Pan-African Ecobank Group aims to help African small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) to adapt to the new, always-shifting digital landscape, according to CNBC, and they’re working with Google on ways to do that.

Ecobank utilizes an eBanking product suite, which, according to a press release, will now integrate with Google functions like Google My Business and Google Ad products.

The suite provides “24/7 access” for customers and will assist with cash management, payment and collection needs that small businesses face, per the announcement.

The digital packages will be available across the sub-Saharan Africa region this month.

Josephine Anan-Ankomah, Ecobank’s executive for commercial banking, praised the partnership with Google and said the changes were “specifically tailored” to the bank’s customers.

“Our objective is to be the partner of choice for SMEs by meaningfully supporting their success and growth,” she said. “It is therefore a natural step for us to work with Google to help improve the capabilities of our SME customers. We are focused on helping them thrive by adopting technology, which is becoming increasingly essential for [the] survival of businesses today.”

According to the release, the technology is especially relevant during the coronavirus pandemic due to the increasing need for digital services. With people staying home more and having to do work remotely, the world has been seeing numerous quick shifts to digital models, in some cases when the companies weren’t prepared to make those transitions.

Ecobank services 33 African countries and has around 20 million customers overall.

Last year, Ecobank worked on speeding up payment systems with a program where merchants could offer unstructured supplementary service data (USSD) and QR code-based mobile retail payment acceptance, which worked to make payments instantaneous. The program resulted in 1 billion NGN ($2.75 million USD) being processed since its start in February 2019, the company said.",en,neutral,0.7442340000000001,positive,0.49463,"['Google', 'Ecobank', 'Ecobank Teams']","['Pan-African', 'CNBC', 'unstructured supplementary service data', 'USSD', 'sub-Saharan Africa', 'Ecobank', 'commercial banking', 'bank', 'USD', 'Google', 'pandemic', 'digital', 'coronavirus', 'SMEs', 'SME', 'Saharan Africa', 'Josephine Anan-Ankomah', 'Google My Business', 'Google Ad', 'Pan-African Ecobank Group', 'eBanking', 'QR']","['SMBs', 'Google', 'Ecobank', 'African', 'digital services', 'small businesses', 'digital', 'African small', 'customers', 'services', 'businesses', 'payment', 'program', 'small', 'technology', 'companies', 'release', 'suite', 'Pan-African', 'CNBC', 'USSD', 'sub-Saharan Africa', 'commercial banking', 'bank', 'USD', 'pandemic', 'coronavirus', 'coronavirus pandemic', 'SMEs', 'SME']","['#Google', '#Ecobank', '#DigitalTerrestrialTelevision', '#SmallAndMediumsizedEnterprises', '#UnstructuredSupplementaryServiceData', '#PanAfricanism', '#CNBC', '#CNBC', '#SubSaharanAfrica', '#CommercialBank', '#Bank', '#SME', '#Coronavirus', '#Pandemic', '#USSD', '#USD', '#UnitedStatesDollar']",9,13,318,2008,2020-05-20 23:38:45+00:00,PYMNTS.com,"{'avatar_url': None, 'id': 975271, 'name': 'Pymnts'}","{'sentences': ['The Pan-African Ecobank Group aims to help African small and '

    SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
(NASDAQ: AMZN): Crucible, the free-to-play competitive team-based shooter from Relentless Studios, an Amazon Games development studio, is now available to download for PC. In Crucible, players work with teammates to hunt their opponents and take down hostile creatures on a lush rogue planet in pursuit of Essence, a valuable resource that amplifies hunters’ powers.

Crucible Launch Trailer: https://youtu.be/zlWgiHRvx30



At launch, players can choose from a diverse roster of 10 hunters, including Earl, an interstellar trucker, Summer, a dual-flame-thrower-wielding former welder, and Bugg, a robot botanist. Each hunter in Crucible has their own unique weapons and abilities, and as they defeat opponents and the planet’s flora and fauna, they level up, gaining strength and enhancing their abilities. Crucible’s fast-paced combat challenges players to constantly re-evaluate and adjust their strategies, adapting to their opponents’ moves and the deadly planet itself.



“I knew Crucible was something special the very first time I played it, and it somehow keeps getting even better,” said Twitch creator Sasslyn. “The hunters are unique, but welcomingly familiar. Whether you want to stick to one or be a jack-of-all-trades, there is a hunter that will fit your preferred style of play. Throughout Crucible’s development, I’ve had the pleasure of seeing first-hand how much the team cares about their players, and the way they take feedback and use it to make Crucible into an even more innovative and unique game.”



""One thing that separates Crucible is the diversity in its characters,” said Twitch creator Bartonologist. “There's something there for everyone. Each character approaches the game differently and matches up against the other hunters in a unique way. Brings a whole new level of strategy and competition to this world.”



“The three game modes in Crucible represent three completely different kinds of teamwork required to come out on top,” said Twitch creator Stevo. “There's unlimited ways you can strategize and compose your team to win, but of course, you never know what your opposition will do either!”



Crucible begins an 8-week Pre-Season today. During this period, players can learn the game, discover and build skill playing their favorite hunters, and begin honing their strategy before Season 1 kicks off. Players who log into Crucible by June 2 will get an early adopter gift of 1,000 Credits deposited into their in-game account. Credits can be redeemed for cosmetic in-game items like skins and emotes, as well as a Pre-Season Battle Pass, available for 950 Credits. The Pre-Season Battle Pass offers players a series of challenges and rewards, including hunter and account customization options.



“As players around the world enter Crucible for the first time today, we’re eager to see how they adapt their strategies to hunt and survive in a constantly changing world,” said Christoph Hartmann, vice president at Amazon Games. “Each new match in Crucible requires fast thinking and quick adaptation to tackle each challenge that comes their way.”



Crucible launches with three game modes:




Heart of the Hives: A 4 vs. 4 battle against giant boss Hives that spawn throughout the world. Each Hive contains a valuable Heart, and the first team to capture three Hearts wins, making each match a dangerous balance between racing the opposing team and surviving the powerful Hives.



Alpha Hunters: Eight teams of two take the battlefield and fight to be the final team standing.



Harvester Command: Two eight-person teams battle to capture and hold Harvesters spread across the map, vying for control of the Essence that drew them all to the planet. Teams earn points by controlling Harvesters and defeating opponents, and the first team to 100 points wins.





Crucible is available for free on PC via Steam. Founder’s Pack bundles, featuring exclusive skins, customization items like in-game decals, and in-game currency, are available for purchase at Amazon or on Steam.



Crucible was developed by Relentless Studios, an Amazon Games development studio located in Seattle. The studio is led by Louis Castle, co-founder of Westwood Studios, and includes industry veterans with previous experience at companies including Activision Blizzard, ArenaNet, and Electronic Arts. The launch of Crucible will be followed by the release of New World from Amazon Games on August 25, 2020.

Chris Turner, general manager for Amazon’s Fulfillment Center/Robotics Building in the Riverside County community of Eastvale, led a tour of the warehouse Wednesday, May 20, to point out all the changes that have occurred since the government-mandated stay-at-home orders and lockdowns took effect.

At 885,000 square feet, four stories and more than 900 employees working per shift, Amazon’s Eastvale facility, referred to as LGB3, is the largest Amazon Fulfillment Center/Robotics Building on the West Coast per volume and head count, Turner said.

In the large break rooms, employees dine one per table, 6 feet apart. To reduce capacity, half the tables have been removed and set up outside the break room to create “open-air break rooms” for employees to also dine 6 feet apart.

					
				

“We created six open-air break rooms here,” Turner said during Wednesday’s tour. “This was definitely the hardest part to address.”

Restrooms are cleaned and sprayed with disinfectant about a dozen times a day, and the three main break rooms and five smaller satellite break rooms are cleaned and sprayed once a day, Turner said.

All employees now have their temperatures taken when entering the building and must wear face masks and gloves at all times. Once prohibited on the work floor, employees now may carry their cellphones in case of emergencies.

Face masks and hand sanitizer are available at distribution stations set up throughout the building.

For the most part, employees have adapted well to the changes and there haven’t been any complaints, Turner said.

					
				

Last month, the state Division of Occupational Safety and Health, or Cal/OSHA, received a complaint from workers at Amazon’s Fulfillment Center in Rialto, that social distancing was not being adhered to at the facility with 300 employees.

Cal/OSHA sent a notice to Scott Merrell, senior workforce, health and safety regulatory affairs manager for Amazon, on April 13 with a directive to investigate the allegations and, if found true, to notify Cal/OSHA within 14 days of all corrective measures taken or in progress.

Cal/OSHA received a response from Amazon on April 28 that is still under review, said Frank Polizzi, a spokesman for the California Department of Industrial Relations, in an email.

“We have responded to the complaint by CALOSHA regarding our site in Rialto … , and strongly believe the steps we have taken related to safety during Covid-19 are in compliance with all appropriate guidelines,” Amazon spokeswoman Eileen Hards said in an email.

In March, Amazon confirmed one employee at the Eastvale Fulfillment Center and one employee from the Moreno Valley Fulfillment Center had tested positive for the novel coronavirus.

Last month, about 350 Amazon warehouse employees called off work to participate in a nationwide protest alleging a lack of safety protocols during the COVID-19 pandemic.

On Wednesday, Amazon would not confirm how many employees at fulfillment centers in Southern California had tested positive for the novel coronavirus, but stressed it was doing everything it could to protect them and take the proper precautions in accordance guidelines from the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control.

“Our top concern is ensuring the health and safety of our employees, and we expect to invest approximately $4 billion from April to June on COVID-related initiatives to get products to customers and keep employees safe,” Hards said in a statement Wednesday.

“This includes spending more than $800 million in the first half of the year on COVID-19 safety measures, with investments in personal protective equipment, enhanced cleaning of our facilities, less efficient process paths that better allow for effective social distancing, higher wages for hourly teams, and developing our own COVID-19 testing capabilities.”

On Wednesday, state Assemblywoman Lorena Gonzalez introduced a bill, AB 3056, to prohibit Amazon from setting unreasonable quotas for employees. In a news release, Gonzalez alleged automated systems at Amazon warehouses generate warnings when too many “time-off tasks” occur during an employee’s shift, and an accumulation of too many warnings can result in a worker’s termination.

“In one facility in Riverside County, employees had to walk for seven minutes to the nearest restroom, leading many to forgo bathroom breaks rather than face penalties for the time-off-task and subsequent termination,” Gonzalez said in the release.

Her bill proposes that workers needing to leave their work stations for legitimate purposes, such as using the restroom or to get a drink of water, not be penalized and have that count as “time-off task.” Employers would face a $250 fine per employee for initial violations and $1,000 per employee for subsequent violations.

Despite the safety concerns at Amazon in recent months, the retail Goliath is still hiring in mass. Since February, more than 2,000 people have been hired at the Eastvale facility and more than 7,000 at facilities across the Inland Empire, Turner said.

Amazon also has assembled “safety committees” of roughly 80 employees at each of its sites. Distinguished by their green-and-yellow vests, their job is to make sure all employees are wearing their masks and social distancing and that face masks and hand sanitizer are well stocked at all stations.

Additionally, Amazon now offers an app employees can download to their phones and use to clock in and out for work.

“So that’s helped us out a lot with social distancing,” Turner said.",en,neutral,0.550171,neutral,0.963261,['Amazon'],"['The Press-Enterprise', 'manager', 'sanitation', 'Amazon', 'OSHA', 'online retailer', 'West Coast', 'Moreno Valley', 'general manager', 'Riverside County', 'Inland Empire', 'disinfectant', 'Rialto', 'Southern California', 'bill', 'California', 'hand sanitizer', 'Jacob', 'Goliath', 'World Health Organization', 'pandemic', 'Chris Turner', 'COVID-19', 'coronavirus', 'Jacob Garcia', 'Terry Pierson', 'Nancy Garcia', 'Scott Merrell', 'Frank Polizzi', 'Eileen Hards', 'Assemblywoman Lorena Gonzalez', 'Gonzalez', 'Despite', 'Cal/OSHA', 'Amazon Fulfillment Centers', 'Fulfillment Center/Robotics Building', 'Eastvale', 'Amazon Fulfillment Center/Robotics Building', 'Turner', 'Amazon Fulfillment Center', 'The Press-Enterprise/SCNG', 'Division of Occupational Safety and Health', 'Fulfillment Center', 'Cal', 'California Department of Industrial Relations', 'CALOSHA', 'Eastvale Fulfillment Center', 'Moreno Valley Fulfillment Center', 'Centers for Disease Control', 'Hards', 'AB 3056', 'Additionally']","['reforms', 'response', 'warehouse', 'coronavirus', 'sweeping', 'Amazon', 'complaints', 'Press-Enterprise/SCNG) Employees', 'Amazon Fulfillment', 'Amazon’s Fulfillment', 'employee', 'COVID-19 safety', 'The Press-Enterprise', 'manager', 'satellite', 'sanitation', 'OSHA', 'online retailer', 'West Coast', 'Moreno Valley', 'general manager', 'Riverside County', 'personal protective equipment', 'Inland Empire', 'disinfectant', 'Rialto', 'Southern California', 'bill', 'California', 'hand sanitizer', 'Jacob', 'Goliath', 'World Health Organization', 'temperature', 'pandemic', 'Chris Turner', 'COVID-19', 'Covid-19', 'novel coronavirus', 'COVID']","['#Amazon', '#ThePressEnterprise', '#Pandemic', '#Coronavirus', '#OSHA', '#OccupationalSafetyAndHealthAdministration', '#ChrisTurner', '#RiversideCountyCalifornia', '#Jacob', '#Temperature', '#HandSanitizer', '#Rialto', '#Bill', '#OnlineShopping', '#GeneralManager', '#WestCoastOfTheUnitedStates', '#Sanitation', '#Disinfectant', '#Satellite', '#Manager', '#California', '#MorenoValleyCalifornia', '#SouthernCalifornia', '#WorldHealthOrganization', '#PersonalProtectiveEquipment', '#Goliath', '#InlandEmpire']",49,50,1670,10274,2020-05-21 01:40:20+00:00,Los Angeles Daily News,"{'avatar_url': None, 'id': 2389274, 'name': 'Joe Nelson'}","{'sentences': ['(Photo by Terry Pierson, The Press-Enterprise/SCNG)\n'

3004962344,Amazon warehouse employees test positive for COVID-19,"Amazon confirmed that an undisclosed number of its employees tested positive for COVID-19 at the company‘s warehouse in San Marcos.

A date indicating when employees were confirmed positive was not specified in a May 20 email from Amazon to The Star. Due to HIPPA laws, it is also unclear whether or not the confirmed cases of Amazon employees were counted in any of Hays County‘s lab-confirmed cases reports.

Amazon spokesperson Jen Crowcroft said the following: We are supporting the individuals who are recovering. Our top concern is ensuring the health and safety of our employees, and we expect to invest approximately $4 billion from April to June on COVID-related initiatives to get products to customers and keep employees safe. This includes spending more than $800 million in the first half of the year on COVID-19 safety measures, with investments in personal protective equipment, enhanced cleaning of our facilities, less efficient process paths that better allow for effective social distancing, higher wages for hourly teams, and developing our own COVID-19 testing capabilities, etc.

The email states when a COVID-19 case is confirmed in one of Amazon‘s locations, the company communicates the news to all individuals who work at the site. It says Amazon asks those who had close contact with an individual infected with COVID-19 to not return to the site and self-quarantine for 14 days.

The company‘s website states when one of its employees is diagnosed with COVID-19, she or he receives two weeks of paid time off in addition to their other paid and unpaid time off options.

The Star will provide more information as it is made available.

3004877328,2bPrecise honored as recipient of the 2020 Microsoft Health Innovation Awards,"This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200520005085/en/

The awards recognize health organizations and their technology solution partners for using Microsoft’s technology solutions in innovative ways that help enable personalized care, empower care teams, improve operational outcomes, protect health information and ultimately reimagine healthcare. The 2020 winners are impacting the industry by creating breakthrough solutions that empower health and life sciences organizations, while meeting global, local and industry-specific compliance and security standards.

A wholly owned subsidiary of Allscripts (NASDAQ: MDRX), 2bPrecise consumes genetic/genomic data from molecular labs and clinical information from EHRs. It synthesizes these elements into a clinical-genomic ontology and brings the resulting insights into the provider’s workflow.

The award nomination featured the precision-medicine success achieved by Murfreesboro Medical Clinic and SurgiCenter in Tennessee (MMC) for its use of pharmacogenomic (PGx) test results at the point of care. Shortly after implementing 2bPrecise, MMC providers analyzed PGx results for a select group of patients who were not responding as well to their psychiatric medications as anticipated. Testing revealed a potential drug-gene interaction in a significant number of these patients. Because PGx insights were available within their workflow, clinicians reevaluated their care plans and wrote new prescriptions for 87% of the patients – with 100% of these individuals then reporting marked improvement in their condition.

Assaf Halevy, co-founder and CEO of 2bPrecise, said he and his team are gratified by the Microsoft award. “It is especially meaningful that we were recognized in the ‘reimagine healthcare’ category. That is precisely what we are trying to do – and we are honored to work with innovators like MMC that display such dedication to improving the quality of care.”

Allscripts established 2bPrecise in 2016, charging the company’s leaders with developing a lab- and EHR-agnostic solution that would help the industry bridge the chasm between scientific advances in genetics and genomics, and their practical application at the point of care.

“Precision medicine is quickly becoming the new standard of care,” said Rick Poulton, President and CFO of Allscripts. “Genetic and genomic information, however, represent an entirely new dataset that needs to be integrated with the provider’s every-day workflow. We are committed to enabling clinicians at any organization – ambulatory or inpatient, academic or community-based – to be able to access and use these insights in a timely manner.”

“During this both challenging and transformational time in the healthcare industry, organizations are using technology to profoundly impact how they deliver care, evolve business operations and help people,” said Patty Obermaier, Microsoft Vice President of U.S. Health and Life Sciences. “This year’s Microsoft Health Innovation Award recipients are advancing the goals of improved patient engagement and care coordination through their innovative use of Microsoft devices, platforms and cloud and AI services.”

Nominations were submitted by health providers, payers, pharmaceutical and life science organizations, and public and private health institutions across the world for applying Microsoft technology to create transformative and highly effective innovations. An esteemed panel of industry experts selected this year’s winners based on how their innovations represented a forward-thinking development or implementation of a solution that is delivering groundbreaking results and producing better health outcomes for more people. Recipients will be highlighted on the Microsoft in Health blog at www.Microsoft.com/Health

The cloud-based 2bPrecise platform consumes genetic/genomic data from molecular labs and clinical information from EHRs, synthesizing them into a clinical-genomic ontology. The 2bPrecise Genomic EHR Mentor (GEM™) brings the resulting precision medicine insights into a physician’s EHR workflow for immediate and timely use. With discrete test results consolidated into an invaluable data set, provider organizations are likewise equipped to drive efficient workflows for genomic interventions, extract population analytics, design clinical intervention programs, build cohorts for trial recruitment, enable participation in research studies and more.

3004971944,"Apple, Google Launch Joint Contact Tracing App","Apple and Google say that 23 countries across five continents have inquired about using the app to track those infected with coronavirus.

Apple  (AAPL) - Get Report and Google's  (GOOGL) - Get Report coronavirus contact tracing system launched Wednesday with iOS 13.5 and in a new update in Google Play.

The companies said that authorities in 23 countries across five continents have sought access to the program which can help health officials track people who have come into contact with those infected with COVID-19.

Apple and Google put restrictions on governments' abilities to collect users' location, phone numbers and other details.

Some governments interested in using the technology are developing apps using their own technology, according to Reuters. Apple says that the additional technology could experience glitches and could drain device batteries.

The two companies were continuing talks with the British government who are testing an app that matches contacts on a centralized server as opposed to Apple and Google's decentralized model.

The two tech giants said the system’s tracking keys will be generated in more random ways. In addition, Bluetooth data will now be encrypted to make it more difficult for specific users to be identified by hackers.

The companies also said that apps using the tool will now limit the recording of the time people are exposed to an infected person to a maximum of 30 minutes.

The tracking system does not use GPS location data and stores the most sensitive data in a decentralized way on users' phones, but it has been criticized for potentially sharing too much private health data. Health and privacy researchers also cited privacy concerns that the companies addressed on Friday by making it harder to use system-generated data to track people.

3004939452,"Healthper USA, Inc. Now Available in the Microsoft Azure Marketplace","Microsoft Azure customers worldwide now gain access to Healthper to take advantage of the scalability, reliability, and agility of Azure to drive well-being.
Hamden, CT,  May 20, 2020 --(PR.com)-- Healthper, your well-being architect, today announced the availability of Healthper programs & challenges in the Microsoft Azure Marketplace, an online store providing applications and services for use on Azure. Healthper customers can now take advantage of the productive and trusted Azure cloud platform, with streamlined deployment and management.



Healthper creates a successful health and wellness experience by maximizing engagement through personalization, coaching, and incentives.



Healthper has launched multiple offers on Azure Marketplace that are available for all size employers in many countries. COVID-19 has brought on new challenges and a new reality that we all have to adjust. Employers can start with a Healthy Mind program challenge that guides individuals in managing their stress and overall mental health during COVID-19 or launch a Healthy Heart program challenge focused on heart health and is available in English and Spanish. Employers have the flexibility to create a customized well-being program that is tailored to the unique needs of their population, including health assessment, incentives management, individual or companywide challenges, biometric and COVID-19 screenings, and tests, using the Healthy You program offer.



Healthper programs are backed by artificial intelligence that increases participation, sustains engagement, and improves health outcomes. These programs contain a unique mix of digital tools, communications, and coaching that motivates members to remain engaged. Personalization paired with the right incentives not only drives to engage but also leads to healthy habits that sustain over a long period.



HR Administrator, a fortune 500 company said, “Prior to Healthper we had very low wellness engagement due to disperse locations, scattered program sites and multiple demographics. Healthper’s team helped us defined our three year wellness strategy that was very specific to the needs of our employees at the 6 locations. Before Healthper we had to deal with the administrative overhead to transfer any earned rewards to our multiple HSA providers. Healthper aggregated all the program needs in a single portal and reward earnings into a single source, and sent the specific contribution reports to the HSA providers. Using Healthper was like having full control of decorating each room separately in a large house but yet having the power to see all of it together.”

3004873494,How the Government’s Antitrust Case Against Google Could Play Out,"Google and the government could negotiate a remedy in lieu of a protracted antitrust battle, but there could also be secondary effects to Google's business practices.

The U.S. Department of Justice and a coalition of states are preparing to sue Google for antitrust violations, opening up what could be one of the most consequential antitrust cases in decades, according to reports.

The DOJ and a group of state attorneys general are planning to file lawsuits in the coming months, according to the WSJ, with the DOJ expected to file as soon as this summer. The government bodies may pursue those cases independently or eventually merge them into one, but the antitrust claims are said to focus on Google’s advertising business.

Shares of Google parent Alphabet  (GOOGL) - Get Report closed 0.78% lower on Tuesday to $1,374.40.

“There’s a lot of momentum now, both politically and administratively, to actually once and for all come to grips with what Google is doing,” said Rick Hamilton, a partner at Ulmer & Berne and former trial lawyer with the DOJ's antitrust division.

There are a few scenarios that could unfold, Hamilton, explained. One is that the government will conclude that the investigations don’t warrant a case -- which appears unlikely at this point, given the interest across the political spectrum in challenging the power of Big Tech.

Provided the DOJ and attorneys general do bring the lawsuit against Google, the parties could negotiate a remedy that resolves the government’s concerns -- perhaps compelling Google to change some aspects of their advertising practices.

“There’s no question both sides will be looking for opportunities to forgo bringing the case, and trying to resolve the concerns of the government in a way, to put it bluntly, that Google can live with,” Hamilton said.

Bringing an antitrust case against Google would likely be a years-long process, with a high bar in proving that the search giant broke the law. The government must successfully convey not only that Google is dominant, but that it sought to preserve its monopoly position by engaging in exclusionary conduct that pushed out competitors.

Traditionally, courts have looked to consumer welfare as a primary framework in antitrust cases: Are prices reasonable? Do consumers choose Google because it’s simply a better experience? The government would have to successfully argue for expanding that framework, Hamilton said.

“The government is going to have to overcome old consumer welfare paradigm ... these aren’t traditional consumer transactions,” he said.

Depending on the final outcome of antitrust proceedings, the impact on Google’s business practices could be significant.

Alphabet earned 82% of its total revenue last year from Google advertising, and in a recent filing, noted various actions taken by antitrust authorities in the European Union.

In that jurisdiction, Alphabet has paid out billions in fines for antitrust violations since 2017, and tweaked certain business practices in response to antitrust complaints. Those include changes to AdSense for Search third-party agreements, changes to its Google shopping ads, and changes to how it distributes Android operating systems.

Significant changes to Google’s advertising practices could carry the risk of capping growth. Earlier this year, fellow ad giant Facebook  (FB) - Get Report cautioned investors that the impact of global privacy regulation and “other ad targeting headwinds” could hamper Facebook’s growth in the quarters to come.

Another potential outcome, according to Hamilton, could be a chillier environment for acquisitions that require regulatory approval.

“I could see in the future -- and not just for Google, but for some of these other tech companies as well -- that the default position will be ‘no,’” Hamilton said.

3004831661,Amazon On How Retail Will Reinvent Itself,"The last several weeks have certainly made for unexpected and unprecedented times for consumers and all players in the retail ecosystem and left a lot of businesses standing at a crossroads as they face the back half of 2020 and questions about what to do next.

And as Amazon’s Vice President Patrick Gauthier noted in a recent digital Fireside chat with Karen Webster, although the Amazon team “can count ourselves lucky” in many ways when it comes to weathering the storm the pandemic has kicked up across the entire economy, they also feel a responsibility to help the recovery process of the hard-hit retail ecosystem and merchants, not all of whom have weathered the economic storm nearly so smoothly.

“Being agile and customer-centric and solution-driven, we think we have an important role to play, to help at the Amazon level,” Gauthier said. He noted they’ve been busy with various initiatives, including the 175,000 person hiring push, COVID-19 research support and enabling easy charitable donations at checkout for consumers, which has raised millions of dollars worldwide. Amazon’s first round of priorities during the crisis, Gauthier explained, was largely around mitigation. Now, they are looking to the second tier of priorities, which he described as focusing on reacceleration or restarting the retail rush for merchants in a world that has shifted widely to digital.

Helping merchants compete on a new, digitally altered playing field, Gauthier told Webster, will be enabled by technology but not defined by it.

“Technology is kind of the means, not the end. For us, the part that we have to keep always in sight is the human component. It’s critical for both the merchant side of our business and the buyer side. And we know that when we lean into the human components, we actually see the velocity of commerce increasing. And when you talk about restarting things, this is all about increasing the velocity.”

Uncertain and unprecedented times have created incredible stress levels for consumers and merchants across the board, Gauthier noted, and both are looking for things that engender feelings of safety and security.  In other words, trust has become a primarily valuable currency of late. The search for trustworthy connection, Gauthier told Webster, is hardly new to the retail ecosystem. It has long been the cornerstone of successful commerce but has gained a new priority as a host of firms are looking to bridge the digital divide and are looking for new ways to create connection points with customers.

“We think of trust as something that is absolutely fundamental and foundational for commerce. Without trust, there’s very little commerce. The data shows this unequivocally,” Gauthier said of research Amazon commissioned late last year that demonstrated that trust had both an emotional and a functional component for customers. Emotionally, it is about a feeling of safety a consumer has in an interaction; functionally, it is about whether the customer can quickly and easily leverage the payment methods they want and check out smoothly and seamlessly without issue.

Trust may have taken on a whole new relevance in the commerce world. However, the ways it can be developed  and convened are unlikely to change much, Gauthier noted, because it is a thing brands build overtime by acting with integrity, transparency and being reliable in delivering on promises — and not “a consequence of technology.”

Any brand or merchant is capable of doing the things that engender trust among partners and consumers, Gauthier told Webster.

“The question then is, can it be done at a sufficient scale?”

Amazon, via services offerings like Amazon Pay or its marketplace, Gauthier noted, can bring merchants an opportunity to go after that scale. If a merchant in recent weeks has found it needs to go digital, integrating Amazon Pay, Gauthier noted, comes with access to an audience wired for eCommerce.

“And the research we’ve done with merchants has shown that they expect both from us, an acceleration of their digital innovation and access to the Amazon audience. Now, mind you, 75 percent of active Amazon Pay users are Prime customers, and they’re fluent in digital shopping. You don’t need to teach them anything. And to the extent that we help the merchant create an experience that is familiar for those digital shoppers, we’re going to help them accelerate their business in a world where digital is important.”

And digital is going to be important for much of the foreseeable future, Gauthier noted.

The View From The Future

What will the world look like at this time in 2021 — how will the pandemic recovery period have permanently changed the retail landscape? That was Webster’s concluding question for Gauthier as their conversation wound down — what will the next evolution of retail look like.

Gauthier noted his limited abilities in seeing the future but said that he believed the changes at first are going to be a bit more subtle than people are anticipating today. The physical store, he noted, will not ultimately be a casualty of COVID-19.

“I look at all the reports not just around the country but around the world of people genuinely wanting to leave their home and genuinely wanting to have human contacts again. And so this is why I do believe that the physical stores are not going away. They satisfy that fundamental need,” Gauthier said.  But what we will see, he noted, is a shift in certain products that people did not think of buying online or in a digital environment. Fitness class a year ago would have looked like a physical experience through and through, but when you look at the success of Peloton to reinvent that experience for digital consumers, consumers may not be getting back to a physical gym any time soon.

The future of retail, he noted, will be about what it has always been about: a conversation between merchants and consumers. It is a conversation that it will be possible to easily carry on across more digital touchpoints as the world adapts to the increased digital innovation pushed forward by the pandemic. The brands that manage to carry it off the best will see the best results navigating the great economic restart and the new landscape that will emerge in its wake.

“I suspect we will see a deeper relationship with brands or a deeper dimension of loyalty  and that will probably be  more subtle and nuanced, but it will be an  important change that occurs over the next 18 months.”",en,neutral,0.465251,positive,0.6209560000000001,"['Amazon', 'How Retail Will Reinvent Itself']","['The View', 'digital divide', 'Amazon', 'velocity', '18 months', 'gym', 'overtime', 'commissioned', 'Fireside chat', 'evolution', 'eCommerce', 'pandemic', 'Vice President', 'digital', 'currency', 'stress', 'bridge', 'COVID-19', 'ecosystem', 'dimension', 'Peloton', 'Patrick Gauthier', 'Karen Webster', 'Webster', 'Amazon Pay', 'Gauthier', 'Fireside', '“Technology', 'Trust', 'The View From The Future']","['Retail', 'Amazon', 'Reinvent', 'Gauthier', 'digital', 'merchants', 'consumers', 'trust', 'retail', 'brands', 'customers', 'physical', 'Webster', 'commerce', 'ways', 'people', 'pandemic', 'The View', 'weathering', 'digital divide', 'velocity', '18 months', 'gym', 'overtime', 'commissioned', 'Fireside chat', 'acceleration', 'evolution', 'eCommerce', 'Vice President', 'currency', 'stress', 'bridge', 'COVID-19', 'ecosystem', 'dimension']","['#DigitalTerrestrialTelevision', '#Amazon', '#Ecosystem', '#Pandemic', '#Velocity', '#VicePresidentOfTheUnitedStates', '#FiresideChats', '#Weathering', '#Stress', '#Currency', '#Bridge', '#DigitalDivide', '#ShipCommissioning', '#Overtime', '#Ecommerce', '#Acceleration', '#TheView', '#Evolution', '#Gym', '#Dimension', '#18Months']",19,44,1100,6491,2020-05-20 09:40:09+00:00,PYMNTS.com,"{'avatar_url': None, 'id': 975271, 'name': 'Pymnts'}","{'sentences': ['And as Amazon’s Vice President Patrick Gauthier noted in a '

3004875993,Google CEO Sundar Pichai says 'hardware is hard' in interview about Pixels,"Last week, we got a rare behind-the-scenes look at what’s going on with the Google Pixel hardware team. Unfortunately, the news was mostly bad, with internal complaints about the Google Pixel 4 design, poor sales of that device, and the exiting of two major players on the Pixel team.

This morning, The Verge published an audio interview conducted with Google’s (and Alphabet’s) CEO Sundar Pichai. During the interview, Pichai discusses the Google Pixel hardware philosophies, the difficulties the company faces, and what the future holds for the Pixel division. He sums it up best when he says very matter-of-factly, “hardware is hard.”

In a summary article of the full interview for The Vergecast, it’s made pretty clear that this interview with Pichai was likely scheduled well before news broke about problems with the Google Pixel hardware team. As such, both Pichai and The Verge probably needed to figure out how to address the fresh news on the fly.

Related: The only reason the Pixel line isn’t Android’s crown jewel is Google

With that in mind, Pichai doesn’t have much revelatory info to give on the situation. He does openly discuss the fact that Google has troubles with creating hardware and gives a synopsis of the company’s three-tier approach to hardware design. Unfortunately, though, he doesn’t go much deeper than that and doesn’t directly discuss the news of the Pixel 4’s apparent lack-of-success, the company’s own misgivings about the product, nor the departures of Google Pixel hardware team magnates Mario Queiroz and Marc Levoy.

Here’s a quote from Pichai about Google Pixel hardware:

The last couple of years have been a major integration phase for us because we’ve combined our Google hardware efforts with Nest. We absorbed the mobile division of HTC. So it’s been a lot of stitching together. And we have a wide product portfolio, too. So it’s definitely been a building phase. We’re super committed to it for the long run. Hardware is hard. And it definitely has components, which take real time to get it right, thinking about underlying silicon or display or camera or any of those tacks. And so we are definitely investing in it, but that timeline. I think we’ve made a lot of progress.

While Pichai saying that there have been difficulties in integrating Google-branded hardware efforts with the Nest team is both true and valid, it doesn’t really paint a rosy picture of Google. When we talk about Google, we talk about one of the richest, most successful companies of all time, with huge power over both the tech industry and all our general lives. To think that a company of that magnitude can’t quickly and seamlessly blend two of its divisions is kind of strange.

Moving on, Pichai discusses the three integral factors of successful hardware — including Google Pixel hardware — as far as he sees it. The full quote is below but see afterward for our bullet-list synopsis of what he’s saying:

One is to drive computing forward. The second is we really guide our ecosystem. Pretty much everything we’ve done well, you can go all the way back and Android’s early days, Samsung Galaxy Nexus, which we worked together, was a pivotal phone. Nexus 7 in the tablet world. I can point to Chromebooks — all along, we did our original hardware to kind of bootstrap it. And I look at areas maybe where we haven’t done opinionated [work] — maybe [smart]watch is a good example where we haven’t. And then you can see it’s tough to guide an ecosystem to what your vision of it is, just building the underlying platform. So I think that’s the second reason. And third is to really build a sustainable hardware business. I think all of it is important, and that’s how I think about it. And I’m excited. Rick [Osterloh] and team, working closely with Hiroshi [Lockheimer] and team, they have that long-term view. So we’re pretty committed to it.

In other words, these are the three things Pichai thinks are integral when it comes to Google Pixel hardware:

Probably the most interesting thing in the quote above, though, is Pichai admitting that Google hasn’t been doing such a good job in the smartwatch space. That’s hardly news to anyone who even passively follows the wearable industry, but interesting to hear from the company CEO.

As I stated earlier, nothing Pichai says during the interview directly responds to the news of turmoil inside the Google Pixel hardware team. However, his statements do give us a bit of a clearer idea of how the company approaches hardware as a whole and that could help explain why Pixel phones look and function the ways in which they do.

The next big piece of Google hardware is the upcoming Google Pixel 4a, which should land at the beginning of June. It will be very interesting to see how that phone (expected to cost just $349) fares in the market, especially in comparison to the much more expensive Google Pixel 4 line.",en,neutral,0.9401889999999999,neutral,0.993597,"['Google', 'Sundar Pichai', 'CEO']","['CEO', 'crown', 'smartwatch', 'bootstrap', 'This morning', 'Pichai', 'division', 'Android', 'Sundar Pichai', 'Galaxy Nexus', 'Mario', 'The Verge', 'silicon', 'Google', 'HTC', 'Chromebooks', 'ecosystem', 'Google Pixel', 'The Vergecast', 'Pixel', 'The Google Pixel', 'Mario Queiroz', 'Marc Levoy', 'Here', 'Rick', 'Hiroshi', 'Google Pixel 4a', 'Alphabet', 'Nest', 'Moving', 'Samsung Galaxy Nexus', 'Nexus 7']","['hardware', 'Pichai', 'hard', 'interview', 'Sundar', 'Pixels', 'Google', 'Sundar Pichai', 'CEO', 'Google hardware', 'Google Pixel', 'Pixel team', 'Pixel', 'company', 'team', 'news', 'division', 'ecosystem', 'time', 'phone', 'crown', 'smartwatch', 'bootstrap', 'This morning', 'Android', 'Galaxy Nexus', 'Mario', 'The Verge', 'integral', 'magnitude', 'silicon', 'HTC', 'Chromebooks']","['#PhichaiDistrict', '#Google', '#CEO', '#ChiefExecutiveOfficer', '#SundarPichai', '#TheVerge', '#Division', '#Android', '#Integral', '#Ecosystem', '#Pixels', '#ThisMorning', '#Crown', '#Mario', '#HTC', '#HTC', '#Silicon', '#ApparentMagnitude', '#GalaxyNexus', '#Chromebook', '#Booting', '#Smartwatch']",15,43,887,4957,2020-05-20 12:24:17+00:00,Google News,"{'avatar_url': None, 'id': 1145331, 'name': 'C.

3004969148,Microsoft’s Surface Book 3 is a powerhouse rival to Apple’s MacBook Pro,"Microsoft has one of the most impressive lines of computer hardware on the market in its Surface family of devices. From the Surface Laptop 3 to the Surface Pro 7, the tech giant has proven time and again that it is a top-flight hardware producer.
And perhaps the most powerful machine in Microsoft’s (MSFT) stable is its new Surface Book 3. A two-in-one hybrid, the Book 3 has a unique construction that allows it to be used either as a laptop or, when you detach its display, as a high-powered tablet.
It’s an impressive system and can handle your most demanding tasks including compiling code, editing video, and playing games, but you’re going to pay a steep price for the privilege of owning one. We’re talking $1,599 for the base 13.5-inch model and, gulp, $2,299 for the 15-inch version.
But despite a few flaws, namely how incredibly hot it can get, it’s a monster of a system that’s sure to please those in need of a Windows-powered beast.
A unique hybrid system
The Surface Book 3 is a laptop-tablet hybrid. But unlike other such devices that have screens that can flip around 360 degrees, the Book 3’s display completely detaches from the system via a special button-activated mechanism.
The mechanism releases the display, allowing it to be used as a tablet on its own. But what’s impressive is, the Book 3’s base isn’t just a bunch of batteries that give the device longer battery life. While the Book 3’s central processing unit (CPU) is built into the display, that’s why there are vents running around the panel’s backside, it’s graphics processing unit (GPU) is built into the base.

More
When you press the detach button, you’re actually telling the system that you want to cut off the GPU from the display. If you’re not actively using the GPU, you’ll be able to detach the screen as soon as you get the “Ready to detach” message. If you’re using the GPU, say you’re playing a game or compiling video, you won’t be able to detach the display. Instead, you’ll see a red light appear on the detach button.
I reviewed the 15-inch version of the Book 3 and found the display to be a bit too large to use as a tablet on its own for long periods of time. Instead, I preferred either using it in laptop mode, or detaching the screen and reattaching it backwards. It’s chunkier than using it as a straight tablet, but more practical for things like watching movies without having the keyboard in the way.
From an aesthetic perspective, the Surface Book 3 shares the same look as the Surface Book 2 and original Surface Book. You’ve got the same industrial design with a large, and super-comfortable keyboard, an accordion-like hinge, along with two USB ports and a media card reader on its left side and a USB C port on its right.
Unfortunately, the USB C port on the Book 3 doesn’t support Thunderbolt connectivity. So you won’t be able to connect, say, an external graphics card to really up the ante on performance to near desktop class.
A fantastic display with tons of performance
Microsoft hasn’t changed much as far as the display for the Surface Book 3 goes, and that’s fine. The company’s PixelSense panel is already one of the best around, and continues to offer fantastic colors and deep blacks.
Inside, the Surface Book 3 gets a completely upgraded hardware setup. Microsoft has thrown in Intel’s (INTC) latest 10th-generation Core Intel Core processors with the 13.5-inch model getting a Core i5 chip or an optional Core i7, and the 15-inch model getting only the Core i7.
The base 13.5-inch model starts at $1,599 with the Core i5 chip, 8GB of RAM, and 256GB of storage. That version features shared graphics processing rather than a discrete GPU, so you shouldn’t expect it to handle high-end games or the kind of video encoding performance you’ll get out of the pricer units.
For comparison, Apple’s (AAPL) 13-inch MacBook Pro with a 10th-gen Core i5 processor starts at $1,799 but also includes 16GB or RAM and 512GB of storage, so you’ll be able to squeeze out more performance, though don’t get the detachable display.
Story continues

The most outrageous Book 3 you can get is the 15-inch model with a 10-gen Core i7 chip, 32GB of RAM, 2TB of storage, and an Nvidia (NVDA) Geforce GTX 1660 Ti graphics chip for $3,399. Yikes.
Apple’s 16-inch MacBook Pro can be equipped with a 9th-gen Core i7 chip, a ridiculous 64GB of RAM, 8TB of storage, and an AMD Radeon Pro 5500M with 6GB of video RAM for (do double-take) $6,099.
I’ve been using the Surface Book 3 with a Core i7 processor, 32GB of RAM, 512GB of storage, and an Nvidia Geforce GTX 1660 Ti chip, and it’s been a performance powerhouse.
When it comes to more demanding processes, playing games for instance, the Book 3 handled most of what I threw at it with ease. “Forza Horizon 4” ran like a dream on the Book 3, while “Metro Exodus,” a game that puts even high-end gaming systems to the test, was only able to run on low settings.
In other words, the system can handle those kinds of games, but it won’t be like running them on a dedicated gaming system.
One thing to note is how incredibly warm the rear of the Surface Book 3’s display got when I was downloading a number of large game files. I set aside the system to download “Forza” and “Metro” and left it on my table with the screen on as I browsed the web. When I lifted it up, I was shocked at how hot the rear panel was to the touch.
Sure, I was pushing its performance, but I’d expect better cooling from the Surface.
As far as battery life, I managed to run my usual day of web browsing, checking email, streaming video, and writing before having to charge up again at the end of my work day.
Should you get it?
The Surface Book 3 offers impressive performance and flexible capabilities in a stylish package that’s uniquely Microsoft. The pricing is hard to swallow, but that can be said of competing systems at this level like Apple’s MacBook Pro.
Average consumers will likely find themselves opting for something on the less expensive side, like Microsoft’s own Surface Laptop 3, which starts at $999, Dell’s $1,199 XPS 13, or Apple’s $999 MacBook Air. Each of those offers quality performance, at a more affordable price.
But those looking for serious firepower and functionality will find the Book 3 to be a worthy buy.

3004900015,"Amazon launches its first big-budget game, a shooter called Crucible","Amazon has ramped up its expansion into the games industry with Wednesday's release of Crucible.

The free-to-play shooter – which incorporates elements similar to popular games like Activision Blizzard's Overwatch, Epic Games' Fortnite and Riot Games' League of Legends -- is Amazon's first big-budget game since Amazon Game Studios, the company's gaming branch, was created in 2012. With Crucible, Amazon Game Studios has finally deviated away from the tablet-based games it produced for years to deliver one of the PC titles initially announced in 2016.

Gaming is not a cornerstone of Amazon's business. Live-streaming platform Twitch, which Amazon acquired in 2014 for $970 million, is the company's only big foothold in the gaming space.

But Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter speculates that the company is looking to enter games distribution ""in the same way that they got into books and music."" Crucible could be an early step towards achieving that goal.

3004940836,"After censorship of gay sex scenes, movie director calls for Amazon boycott","Francis Lee, the director of the film ""God's Own Country,"" called for a boycott of Amazon after the company appeared to censor gay sex scenes from his 2017 film, stating that the version available on the platform is not the movie he ""intended or made.""

""Dear friends in USA, God’s Own Country appears to have been censored on @PrimeVideo (Amazon Prime),"" Lee tweeted Wednesday. ""Until this is investigated please do not rent or buy on Amazon Prime.""

A British drama starring Josh O'Connor and Alec Secăreanu, ""God's Own Country"" explores the relationship between a sheep farmer and a Romanian migrant worker. While it received widespread acclaim and was even heralded as a ""Yorkshire Brokeback Mountain,"" according to critic reviews on Rotten Tomatoes, the film was banned in some Arab and Eastern European countries for its sex scenes.

Amazon did not immediately respond to NBC News' request for comment regarding its alleged censorship of the movie, however, reviews of the movie on its site appeared to corroborate Lee's claim that those who watch the movie via Amazon Prime are presented with an abridged version.

""The movie itself is a good story; I am just disappointed in Amazon Prime for editing out certain scenes,"" read one review dated May 16. ""Shame on you for censorship.""

""This version on Amazon Prime is missing the graphic scenes, which really takes away from the film,"" read another, dated May 6.

This latest accusation of censorship coincides with a long-standing charge against Amazon for offering anti-LGBTQ content on its platforms. Last year, the company removed books about conversion therapy, which refers to efforts to change an LGBTQ person’s gender identity or sexual orientation and has been condemned by nearly every major health association, in response to global activism. And in 2018, the company removed a gay conversion therapy app from a religious group called Living Hope Ministries, which included anti-gay podcasts, articles and devotionals, following complaints from LGBTQ advocacy organizations.",en,neutral,0.811812,neutral,0.635955,"['Amazon', 'gay', 'censorship', 'boycott']","['Amazon Prime', 'Francis Lee', 'censorship', 'Arab', 'health association', 'sheep', 'Amazon', 'sexual orientation', 'tweeted', 'NBC News', 'Yorkshire', 'Romanian', 'gay', 'Brokeback Mountain', 'boycott', 'LGBTQ', 'Rotten Tomatoes', 'God', 'gender identity', 'Yorkshire Brokeback Mountain', 'Lee', ""Josh O'Connor"", 'Alec Secăreanu', 'Living Hope Ministries']","['movie', 'director', 'Amazon', 'scenes', 'boycott', 'censorship', 'gay', 'Amazon Prime', 'Country', 'film', 'company', 'Prime', 'LGBTQ', 'reviews', 'therapy', 'version', 'conversion', 'platform', 'devotionals', 'articles', 'complaints', 'widespread', 'Francis Lee', 'conversion therapy', 'gay conversion therapy', 'Arab', 'health association', 'sheep', 'sexual orientation', 'migrant worker', 'tweeted', 'NBC News', 'Yorkshire', 'Romanian', 'Brokeback Mountain', 'Rotten Tomatoes', 'God', 'gender identity']","['#AmazonPrime', '#Censorship', '#Amazon', '#God', '#Gay', '#Boycott', '#ConversionTherapy', '#LGBTQ', '#LGBT', '#FrancisLee', '#Twitter', '#Sheep', '#RomanianLanguage', '#MigrantWorker', '#Yorkshire', '#BrokebackMountain', '#RottenTomatoes', '#Arabs', '#NBCNews', '#GenderIdentity', '#SexualOrientation', '#MedicalCollege']",7,12,339,2041,2020-05-20 17:07:49+00:00,NBC News,"{'avatar_url': None, 'id': 968615, 'name': 'Gwen Aviles'}","{'sentences': ['Francis Lee, the director of the film ""God\'s Own Country,"" '

3004860972,"""Premium"" Google Pixel 5 powered by Snapdragon 765G could be priced at US$699: Is Google shooting itself in the foot or is the pricing just about right?","The upcoming Google Pixel 4a and Pixel 5 could be priced at US$349 and and US$699, respectively as indicated by a recent Google Opinion Rewards survey. While the Pixel 4a pricing makes it a good alternative to the iPhone SE 2020, it remains to be seen if the ""Premium"" Google Pixel 5 can withstand the continued onslaught of Android flagship killers or even the upcoming iPhone 12.

The Google Pixel 5 may be cheaper than the current Pixel 4 by US$100 if a recent Google Opinion Rewards survey is anything to go by. The survey asked users what would their choice be if a Google Pixel phone and a Premium Google Pixel Phone were the only options available. The Google Pixel phone was indicated as having a price tag of US$349 (US$14.54 per month) implying that this could very well be the Pixel 4a that is slated to launch in the coming weeks. The Premium Google Pixel Phone, on the other hand, was shown to be priced at US$699 (US$29.13 per month) and this is very well likely to be the upcoming Pixel 5.

A Pixel 4a priced at US$349 could offer an excellent alternative to what is probably the best budget smartphone at this time, the US$399 Apple iPhone SE (2020). The more interesting part, however, is the US$699 pricing for the Pixel 5. At this price, the Pixel 5 definitely undercuts most flagship Android offerings available. But here's the catch. The Pixel 5 is rumored to sport just a Snapdragon 765G 5G and not the flagship Snapdragon 865 SoC, which would lead many to consider it as an upper mid-range device and not a true flagship.

Further evidence that the Pixel 5 will be powered by the Snapdragon 765 comes via XDA Senior Member cstark27. While analyzing the pre-installed EUICCGoogle APK in Android 11 Developer Preview 4, cstark27 discovered that the APK was updated with a reference to Google's upcoming devices as evidenced by the presence of a new line in the ""modem_model_mappings_json"" string pointing to a ""g7250"" modem. The reference to this g7250 modem implies that the SoC could be a Snapdragon 765, 765G, or the 768G as all three are pin and software compatible.

Android Police Editor-in-Chief David Ruddock also claimed on Twitter that his sources confirmed that the Pixel 5 would indeed be powered by the Snapdragon 765 and that there would be no Google phone with a top-tier CPU this year.

With increasing evidence pointing to an upper mid-range SoC for the Pixel 5, is Google right in pricing the device at US$699? Yes and no. Yes, when compared to previous Pixels but no when compared to the competition. While most popular Android flagships including the OnePlus 8 are on par or above this price, they also feature flagship SoCs and possibly larger batteries than the Pixel 5 would offer. Heck, even the much cheaper Poco F2 Pro outclasses the Pixel 5 in terms of sheer specifications. However, the Pixel will always have the advantage of better cameras and a robust stock Android experience.

At a US$699 price, the Pixel 5 would also have to face competition from the Apple camp particularly from the iPhone 11. The iPhone 11 is powered by the A13 Bionic — a vastly more powerful SoC than anything that the Android camp offers. The iPhone 11, however, loses out on areas such as the display (it is still a great LCD panel) and the lack of a telephoto lens. The upcoming iPhone 12 will further widen the performance gap, offer much improved cameras, and may even retail at a lower US$649 price point for the base model with 128 GB storage.

It is still early days to speculate on how exactly the market would respond to the Pixel 5. The sales for the Pixel 4 haven't really been encouraging with only two million units being sold in the first six months. The overall experience matters more than just mere specs, and Google definitely has perfected this art over the past few years. That being said, with the increasing proliferation of Android flagship killers and Apple's new found trend of competitive pricing, Google will have to offer enough differentiation to make the Pixel 5 stand out from the crowd either in terms of features or via further reductions in price.",en,neutral,0.9273540000000001,positive,0.820385,"['Google', 'Snapdragon']","['smartphone', 'Bionic', 'Twitter', 'CPU', 'iPhone', 'SoC', 'SoCs', 'survey', 'Snapdragon', 'telephoto lens', 'Android', 'modem', 'iPhone SE', 'Pixels', 'LCD', 'Google', 'Poco', 'onslaught', 'OnePlus', 'flagship', 'A13', 'Apple', 'Premium', 'The Google Pixel', 'Google Pixel', 'GB', 'Further', 'Android Police', 'David Ruddock', 'Google Pixel 4a', 'Pixel 4', 'Snapdragon 865', 'EUICCGoogle APK', 'Snapdragon 765', 'A13 Bionic', 'Pixel 5', 'Google Opinion', 'Pixel', 'Pixel Phone', 'The Premium Google Pixel Phone', 'XDA', 'APK', 'F2']","['Google', '765G', 'shooting', 'Snapdragon', 'foot', 'Pixel', 'pricing', 'Premium', 'Google Pixel', 'Android flagships', 'Android flagship', 'flagship Snapdragon', 'Android', 'iPhone', 'flagship', 'device', 'cameras', 'cstark27', 'competition', 'Apple', 'smartphone', 'Bionic', 'Twitter', 'CPU', 'SoC', 'SoCs', 'survey', 'telephoto lens', 'modem', 'iPhone SE', 'Pixels', 'LCD', 'Poco', 'onslaught', '5G', 'OnePlus', 'A13']","['#Android', '#Google', '#QualcommSnapdragon', '#Flagship', '#IPhone', '#SystemOnAChip', '#Surveying', '#IPhoneSE', '#Modem', '#AppleInc', '#Onslaught', '#Smartphone', '#5G', '#Twitter', '#CPU', '#CentralProcessingUnit', '#Pixel', '#OnePlus', '#Poco', '#A13Road', '#Bionic', '#LCD', '#LiquidcrystalDisplay', '#TelephotoLens']",8,29,744,4109,2020-05-20 11:35:23+00:00,Google News,"{'avatar_url': None, 'id': 1355955, 'name': 'Vaidyanathan Subramaniam'}","{'sentences': ['While the Pixel 4a pricing makes it a good alternative to the '

3004892777,Microsoft just built 'one of the top five most powerful' supercomputers on the planet,"Microsoft has announced a new supercomputer built by the company in partnership with and for OpenAI to train large-scale AI models. The Seattle-based company said at its Build conference for developers that this is one of the top five publically disclosed supercomputers.

Last year, Microsoft invested $1 billion in OpenAI with a goal to build supercomputers that leverages Azure’s cloud services. Now, that investment is showing its first results.

In terms of specifications, the new supercomputer packs some impressive numbers. It a single system with more than 285,000 CPU cores, 10,000 GPUs, and 400 gigabits per second of network connectivity for each GPU server.

Both companies said they want to build multitasking large-scale AI models to make them available for developers and the public to use. Microsoft said that the end goal is to make its large AI models, training optimization tools, and supercomputing resources available through Azure AI services and GitHub for researchers.

Earlier this year, the tech giant unveiled a 17-billion parameter natural language generation model. With this supercomputer and its AI at scale program, Mircosoft aims to create more such generic models and open-source it.

The search engine is honoring Israel Kamakawiwo'ole on May 20 in honor of what would be his 61st birthday. The Hawaiian singer-songwriter is known for his beloved rendition of “Somewhere Over the Rainbow.” Google said it also featured him in honor of Asian Pacific American Heritage month in the U.S.

Google wrote on its Google Doodle page that late one night in 1988, Kamakawiwo'ole sat down in a Honolulu studio, closed his eyes, and in a single take, sang an emotional `ukulele-backed version of the classic song, “Somewhere Over the Rainbow.” Little did he know, this recording—which serves as the soundtrack of today`s video Doodle—was destined to become an international phenomenon.
                                            

                    
“But Israel is so much more than one song; with his band and successful solo career, he redefined popular Hawaiian music through his own unique style and spread his love for the islands around the world.
                                            

                    
Thank you, Israel, for providing the soundtrack for Hawai`i and for continuing to move hearts around the world through your music,” Google wrote.
                                            

                    
According to cnet.com, Kamakawiwo'ole’s rendition of the song reached as high as No. 12 on Billboard’s Hot Digital Tracks chart. It also appeared on the soundtracks of several movies, including 50 First Dates and Meet Joe Black.

3004956928,Approaching a fork in the Covid Road: Apple + Google or 1984,"As the U.S. contemplates routes to economic recovery in response to Covid-19, it is hurtling toward a fork in the road. A sustainable approach to contact tracing is becoming the central issue in economic recovery. The U.S. still has two choices: a light-weight, human-centric approach or a heavy-weight, machine-centric approach. The clock is ticking; the sand is draining from the hourglass as we avoid both options in futile hope of some third possibility.

The light-weight, human-centric approach is the hermetically-sealed perfection of the proposed Apple/Google app-based solution for non-intrusive contact tracing in a distributed architecture. The Apple/Google initiative, positioned as “exposure notification,” would enable us to restore social and economic activity without unleashing a biological catastrophe. We’ve become familiar with the need for testing to accompany a relaxation in social distancing; testing is futile without contact tracing. Without contact tracing, we have no way of knowing if and when individuals who test negative are subsequently exposed. We would literally need to test continuously. Likewise, contact tracing must be accompanied by testing in order to trigger notifications when individuals test positive.
 



The heavy-weight, machine-centric approach is the oppressive, almost draconian location-based solution for extremely intrusive contact tracing that we are seeing in Singapore and South Korea — as those regimes respond to the infection spikes that correspond to premature relaxation. We can say that such extreme measures would never fly in the U.S. — let’s see what policymakers and their constituencies say when we relax prematurely and, like other regimes, we hit a spike that takes us back to the future.

The options are clear: 


Relax while avoiding contact tracing, hit a spike, revert to extreme social distancing, and deploy a heavy-weight approach to contact tracing; Or 

Relax while deploying a light-weight approach to contact tracing and avoid a spike.



A poll conducted by The Washington Post and the University of Maryland indicates that only 40% of Americans are willing and able to implement the Apple/Google solution. We need 60% minimum — and even 60% is a bare minimum. While the Apple/Google initiative has gained traction in Germany and Italy, France and the U.K. are still in limbo and public-health agencies in the U.S. have generally disregarded it. Probably rooted in distrust of technology and loss of control, U.S. agencies typically envision a manual approach implemented by “armies” of contact tracers. Other perspectives suggest that employers, rather than public-health agencies, will be the organizational locus of contact tracing. While the various parties deliberate, the option of a light-weight approach recedes.

The evaluation of a manual approach seems to consider volume, not speed and accuracy. While manual approaches could probably manage volume over time, we don’t have time. By the time that a manual process traces the first tier of contacts, those contacts will have spread the infection to the next tier and beyond, as the spread grows exponentially. A manual approach is feasible at a small scale; it is not feasible at a large scale. The accuracy of the manual approach is also an issue — historical experience has shown that human recall, especially over a two-week period, is problematic. Infected individuals aren’t always cooperative with the investigation. As we attempt to scale the manual approach, infected individuals will find that the perceived intrusiveness of the automatic approach would be a relief in comparison.

An employer-centric approach would be location-based; employers can’t enforce adoption off-site. There is no way of tracking exposure that occurs off-site/off-hours. It’s a leaky system. In order to be effective, contact tracing needs to be comprehensive. Even if employers could enforce off-site use of a particular app, their systems wouldn’t integrate with the interactions that their employees are having off-site. Their apps won’t have interoperability with the apps of other employers. Employer-centric proliferation of apps may seem practical as a site-level response, but it fails as a system-level response.

While the Apple/Google solution solves the integration and scalability issues, users resist adoption. Their privacy concerns are justified. In a typical example of Silicon Valley myopia, Apple and Google produced a brilliant technical solution that ignores the behavioral and social context. The overall fabric of contact tracing is a socio-technical system — the technical system operates in the context of a social system. Every system operates in the context of a super-system. How will we get to 60% adoption — or even 80%? While the technical solution is reasonably convincing, even to a skeptic, the organizational system isn’t slightly convincing, even to an optimist. No trusted intermediary has visibility into the Apple/Google “machine room”. The Apple/Google initiative should not have a free hand — it requires third-party supervision. With third-party supervision by a formidable privacy advocate like American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), a 60% adoption rate becomes conceivable. Skeptics argue that even Singapore has achieved adoption by only a third of its population; in the U.S., Utah launched an app-based approach and has achieved only a 1% adoption rate. With third-party supervision, we can reverse that momentum — we can turn our open and balanced social system to our advantage and out-perform even Singapore.

Like the vendors, the public-health agencies also must make concessions: they need to provide visibility into configuration and administration of the solution by a trusted intermediary; and they need to abandon their visions of location-based tracking and global visibility into consumer behavior.

ACLU has indicated its expectations for app-based contact tracing: a voluntary and distributed implementation. It is prepared to take legal action in order to enforce its expectations. The Apple/Google initiative has conveniently delivered a solution that potentially satisfies those expectations. Privacy advocates in Germany and the U.K. have endorsed the Apple/Google solution. ACLU and public-health agencies make strange bedfellows; ACLU and Apple/Google also make strange bedfellows. The Apple / Google initiative itself is surely an un-conventional alignment… until the age of Covid. Strange times call for strange combinations. All of the parties need to “give a little bit”. If consumers resist the Apple / Google option, the situation will devolve into an employer-centric and location-based approach that is fragmented and oppressive; agencies and employers will be able to legitimately enforce it without respect for privacy.

The path to freedom: Public-health agencies should adopt the Apple / Google initiative on the condition of third-party supervision (and their constituencies should encourage that direction); the agencies should relax social distancing on the condition of sufficient adoption (and their constituencies should embrace that contingency). We need an integrated, scalable, and non-intrusive approach to contact tracing. It’s an obstacle course. 

This approach to the organizational context of contact tracing solves the tension between effectiveness and intrusiveness; it solves the tension between private rights and the public interest. Agencies, vendors, and consumers all need to “give a little bit”. Europe is trending in the human-centric direction while Asia is trending in the machine-centric direction. The U.S. has a choice; the U.S. needs to make a sustainable decision. That fork in the road still approaches; that sand is still draining from the hourglass.

3004967198,Apple and Google roll out their new exposure notification tool. Interest seems limited.,"The Apple-Google exposure notification tool, announced on April 10, is one step closer to being launched. The two companies released software that will help public health authorities build apps that incorporate their exposure notification tool. Apple, specifically, rolled out a software update to iOS devices that some users could download immediately. This big public unveiling raises a couple very important questions: Will any government agencies actually build those apps? And will anybody use them? 

These questions remain unanswered. They also raise another, more essential question: How will the new Apple-Google tool help the world fight the pandemic? The companies sold the concept early on as part of a tech-based solution to a very hard problem. But now, Apple and Google admit the tool is not meant to be a silver bullet.

Yet, there is progress. Following the late April release of a beta version of the technology, Apple and Google announced on Wednesday that the application programming interface (API) for its exposure notification tool is now being released to public health authorities. According to the companies, several countries and three US states — Alabama, North Dakota, and South Carolina — will base their digital contact tracing apps on the tool. While Apple and Google consulted with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to build the tool, there is no indication that any nationwide app is forthcoming.

“Starting today, our Exposure Notifications technology is available to public health agencies on both iOS and Android,” Apple and Google said. “Today, this technology is in the hands of public health agencies across the world who will take the lead and we will continue to support their efforts.”

One of the early adopters of the Apple-Google tool is North Dakota, a state that has already struggled with contact tracing technology of its own.

“North Dakota is excited to be among the first states in the nation to utilize the exposure notification technology built by Apple and Google to help keep our citizens safe,” Gov. Doug Burgum said in a statement. “As we respond to this unprecedented public health emergency, we invite other states to join us in leveraging smartphone technologies to strengthen existing contact tracing efforts, which are critical to getting communities and economies back up and running.”

What remains to be seen is how many states will accept North Dakota’s invitation. Several states have told Recode that they don’t plan to incorporate the Apple-Google tool into their apps or contact tracing plans.

That’s surprising, given the initial optimism when the exposure notification tool was first announced. Apple and Google, the companies behind the tool as well as the operating systems used by the vast majority of smartphones in the world, teamed up in the early weeks of the pandemic to create the infrastructure on which a Bluetooth-based contact tracing system could be built. This partnership was unprecedented, reminiscent of the well-worn trope where sworn enemies team up to fight the greater threat. It meant that any app using the tool would have a significantly lower bar to widespread adoption, especially once Apple and Google integrated the new technology into the phones’ operating systems themselves.

Additionally, many — though certainly not all — of privacy advocates’ concerns were addressed by the tool’s strict requirements. Those included that users be kept anonymous; no location data be used; data stay on users’ devices rather than go to a centralized database maintained by a government authority; the system be opt-in only; and that the tool ends when the pandemic threat is over. Altogether, the proposition seemed like a win-win. Surely public health authorities would be champing at the bit to use it.

But with the release of the API, which represents a milestone in the development of a new breed of iOS and Android public health apps, the reality seems different. 

First of all, the implementation of the tool is not quite what was initially expected. Two weeks after the initial announcement in early April, Apple and Google changed the name of its technology to downplay its role, calling it an “exposure notification” tool rather than a “contact tracing” tool. This was meant to stress the tool’s role as an aid to contact tracing efforts rather than the contact tracing effort itself. Apple-Google have repeatedly stressed that they have only created a tool, and it is up to public health authorities to develop, implement, and manage apps based on it as they see fit (within Apple-Google’s strict guidelines, of course).

Some countries publicly clashed with Apple-Google over its privacy-preserving restrictions and developed their own apps when Apple-Google wouldn’t budge on things like allowing them to have a centralized database. But apps that didn’t use the Apple-Google tool drew complaints that they were buggy and didn’t work correctly, as only apps that used the tool could run smoothly using minimal battery life in the background. 

So other countries have decided it was worth agreeing to Apple and Google’s terms and conditions to have the best possible chance of producing a functional app. But with no location data being tracked and no centralized database to store it, the apps they could build are severely limited in the amount of data they can collect. And therefore, public health authorities can get limited benefits from the apps that use the Apple-Google tool.

In the absence of a national effort led by the Trump administration, individual states are beginning to reopen and assemble a patchwork of contact tracing plans. This raises the question of which states, if any, are willing to make use of the tool at all. 

In an attempt to answer this question, Recode asked Apple and Google multiple times if any public health authorities had agreed to use it. Aside from the mention of participation from Alabama, North Dakota, and South Carolina in press materials, the companies did not offer any details of more widespread adoption. Recode also reached out to all 50 states as well as Washington, DC, and the Department of Health and Human Services to ask if they were planning to use the Apple-Google tool. Of the 30 states that responded, none confirmed they were using it, and several said they weren’t. 

But again, we now know there are at least three using the tool, though it’s unclear how far along they are in developing their apps. 

North Dakota told Recode it already had an app, called CARE19, and then spoke to the Washington Post about its struggles getting Apple and Google to let it use their tool in its existing app. The CARE19 app uses location data, which the Apple-Google tool forbids, so North Dakota ended up building a second, separate app using the new exposure notification tool. 

Alabama Department of Public Health’s Karen Landers told Recode on May 18 that the state “has not decided” whether to use the Apple-Google tool. Two days later, Alabama announced that, along with the University of Alabama System and the University of Alabama at Birmingham, it had a “partnership” with Apple and Google to “harness technology to accelerate exposure notification to slow the spread of COVID-19.” 

South Carolina, which did not respond to Recode’s request for comment, announced today that it was using the Apple-Google tool for its SC Safer Together app.

Other states indicated to Recode that they were focusing their limited resources on a tried and true contact tracing tool called human beings. This involves health officials questioning people about who they’ve seen in an effort to trace the spread of the virus, and the states using human-based contact tracing will use with technology to organize and facilitate their efforts, rather than replace them. A recent ProPublica report suggests that this may still be the best method, with health experts saying that something like the Apple-Google tool, which relays no data back to public health authorities and relies on widespread adoption to be effective, will be of limited use. 

So, many states seem to be using a mixture of new and old-fashioned methods. Maryland, for example, is using a platform called “COVID Link” to assist traditional contact tracing methods after a known exposure, as opposed to contact tracing apps that track all contact whether or not someone tests positive. As Charles Gischlar of the Maryland Department of Health told Recode, the state “continues to explore all options and technologies available, but there are currently no plans to use contact tracing apps.” 

North Carolina is taking a similar tack. Amy Adams Ellis of the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services told Recode that the state is “using a new software system to support contact tracing efforts.” That system does not include the apps that use Bluetooth, GPS, or other location-based tools.

Several states are using a tool called Sara Alert. Built by the nonprofit Mitre Corporation, Sara Alert is an open source project developed with the cooperation of several state public health authorities, which is similar in some ways to what Apple and Google are trying to do. Arkansas, Idaho, and Pennsylvania all told Recode they were using the Sara Alert system. 

There are other privately built tools, too. Hawaii told Recode it was using an app developed by HealthSpace, and Connecticut told Recode it was using a system from Microsoft (dubbed “ContaCT”). Meanwhile, Washington state is still not sure it wants an app at all.

“Apps are not for everyone and while they may help in the process, we are going to start each contact investigation by calling each person,” Barbara LaBoe, spokesperson for Washington state’s COVID-19 Response team, told Recode. “We also are still working to get an understanding of the various privacy and security issues involved in those apps and tools,” LaBoe added.

Finally, the state hit hardest by the pandemic, New York, told Recode, “We are evaluating various technology applications that could assist in the initiative, but the key to effective contact tracing is direct outreach by individuals to work with a positive case to successfully identify their contacts.”

At the time of the API launch, Apple and Google would only say that several states have expressed interest in the tool. The companies would not give an exact number or offer more details about plans from public health authorities. Some states indicated to Recode that they are taking a wait-and-see approach, so it’s possible that several may join Alabama, North Dakota, and South Carolina in the coming days. It’s also possible that some states will change their minds and come around to the Apple-Google technology. That’s what Germany did. In fact, of the many countries using contact tracing apps, a handful of countries like Austria, Ireland, and Switzerland have committed to using the Apple-Google tool. 

In the weeks to come, significant questions remain about how successful contact tracing and exposure notification technology will be. This depends on how many people download and use the technology offered in their region, not to mention the integration of other efforts, like human-based contact tracing. So while the Apple-Google tool hasn’t had the universal acceptance that might have been expected when the tool was first announced, it’s not a total flop.

By all appearances, it looks like Apple-Google wanted to contribute to society and make their mark on fighting the spread of coronavirus, and that’s laudable. But it’s now clear that the two companies also, characteristically, wanted to do it only on their terms, even if it meant reducing the efficacy of the apps based on their tool from a public health agency perspective. And when two massive companies control nearly 100 percent of the smartphones out there between them, they can dictate whatever terms they want — even in a worldwide crisis.

3004955141,Amazon Ups Ante in Videogaming Space With 'Crucible' Launch,"Amazon has upped the ante in its bid to become a big player in the videogaming space with the launch of ""Crucible.""

Amazon.com  (AMZN) - Get Report today launched ""Crucible,"" its first big-budget PC videogame since it entered the business eight years ago and a sign the tech and online retail behemoth is accelerating its push into the sector.

The hero-shooter game, which has garnered mainly positive reviews, features a diverse cast of heroes, or ""hunters,"" who battle it out on a ""large, jungle-like planet in a sci-fi future,"" according to Wired.

The game offers a mix of features similar to other popular big-budget games of the same genre, including ""Fortnite,"" ""Overwatch,"" and ""Apex Legends.""

""Crucible felt like a charming, competitive, strategy shooter thoughtfully designed to incorporate the most loveable qualities of today's multiplayer games,"" Wired said in an initial review.

The launch has some analysts speculating that the Seattle company wants to become a major player in the gaming space along the lines of what it has done in other sectors, like books and music.

Amazon in 2014 bought live-streaming platform Twitch for $970 million, giving it an, large initial beachhead in the gaming business.

3004857448,Google celebrates Israel Kamakawiwo'ole with new Doodle,"May 20 (UPI) -- Google is celebrating late singer-songwriter Israel 'IZ' Kamakawiwo'ole with a new Doodle on what would have been his 61st birthday and in honor of Asian Pacific American Heritage Month in the U.S.

Kamakawiwo'ole was born in 1959 in a suburb of Honolulu. He was raised in a native islander family who loved Hawaiian music. At 10-years-old he started to carry his ukulele everywhere.

The musician, his brother and three friends, formed contemporary Hawaiian music group Makaha Sons of Ni'ihau, achieving success across 15 albums.

Kamakawiwo'ole recorded in 1988 his most famous track, a cover of ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow."" The song has been featured in a number of films, television shows, commercials and remains on various Billboard charts to this day.

Google's homepage features artwork of Kamakawiwo'ole alongside a play button that starts an animated music video of ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow.""

The music video, directed by Doodler Sophie Diao, follows Kamakawiwo'ole's life and how Hawaii continues to celebrate him.

3004938525,"DOJ, state attorneys ready to bring antitrust lawsuits against Google","(Natural News) The Department of Justice (DOJ) is reportedly moving forward with the filing of antitrust lawsuits against Alphabet Inc., the parent company of Google, which also owns YouTube.

According to The Wall Street Journal (WSJ), people familiar with the matter have confirmed that the DOJ, in conjunction with various state attorneys general, is well into the planning stages of unleashing litigatory hell on Alphabet, which continues to engage in techno-fascism against online free speech.

The DOJ case against Alphabet could come as soon as this summer, the WSJ says, while a coalition of state attorneys general led by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, a Republican, is planning to file its own case probably closer to the fall.

An investigation by the DOJ has confirmed that Alphabet owns the “dominant tool at every link in the complex chain between online publishers and advertisers,” the WSJ says. Thus, the DOJ is focusing primarily on the company’s online advertising business, as well as its advertising technology.

The DOJ is also looking into concerns that many have expressed about how Google is using its dominant search business to stifle competition, meaning it has become more difficult than ever to browse the web and pull up information without having to run queries through Google-owned platforms.

The biggest impediment currently is the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) crisis, which has stifled efforts to really get this process moving with the swiftness it deserves. Public health and reopening efforts have basically forced these probes to take somewhat of a back seat for the time being.

Even so, Attorney General William Barr has indicated that considerable resources are being devoted to holding Google accountable, and that his agency is still treating its inquiry as a top priority. The same goes for the individual states pursuing legal action against Google.

“We’ve issued [civil subpoenas] to Google and impacted third parties,” stated Paxton. “We hope to have the investigation wrapped up by fall. If we determine that filing is merited we will go to court soon after that.”

Paxton is in full agreement with the DOJ that such efforts seek only to increase competition for consumers, allowing them a greater range of options when it comes to how they use the internet. And by sharing information between themselves, Paxton, the DOJ, and the rest of the attorneys general hope to expedite the process.

Based on all that has been gathered thus far, the DOJ says that all signs point to there being a strong case against Google and Alphabet. Still, no final decisions have been made, and there is a possibility that all of this will be settled without any litigation.

What still remains unclear is whether individual states will file their own complaints or join the federal case once it gets filed. There is also the possibility that groups of states will file their own respective complaints, depending on which angle they decide to take.

While Texas has focused its investigation on Google’s ad services, other states are looking more at Google’s search function. Whatever the case may be, these lawsuits could lead to the undoing of Google as the global leader in search and advertising, which would certainly be a great thing for the average consumer.

The culmination of these efforts has been a long time coming, especially after the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), which shares antitrust authority with the DOJ, opened and later closed an investigation into Google back in 2013. The evidence was apparently not strong enough back then, but is now.

3004790012,It's official  Amazon to build fulfillment center at Boxwood site,"It's official.

Amazon formally announced that the company will operate a fulfillment center at the former GM Boxwood site near Newport. No opening date was listed.


The project, which had previously been endorsed for a $4.5 million state Strategic Grant, will employ more than 1,000. Delaware was the site of the first distribution center destination for the state. Amazon still operates a center in the New Castle area that opened in 1997. At the time, Amazon was a bookseller.


The second Amazon center opened in 2012 in Middletown.


The company now has more than 100 fulfillment centers in North America and 185 worldwide.


""Amazon already employs more than 2,500 Delawareans, and we welcome additional investment that will result in more jobs for Delaware families - especially at vacant industrial sites that are ideal for redevelopment,"" said Gov. John Carney. ""Delaware has a world-class workforce, a central location, and a quality of life that is second to none. For those reasons and more, Delaware is a great place for businesses of all sizes to grow and create jobs.""


Amazon will lease a build-to-suit building, developed by Dermody Properties, at the site of the former General Motors' Wilmington assembly plant, which closed in 2009 and was demolished in 2019.


The building does not appear to have the multi-level design concept that was first submitted to New Castle County.


This is Dermody Properties' first venture in Delaware.Jeffrey A. Zygler, a partner at DermodyProperties said, ""Delaware officials and regulatory agencies have been very responsive to our needs, which is paramount in projects of this magnitude. Their collaborative approach and commitment allowed us to attract Amazon to our project.""


The project did see scattered opposition that viewed state grant for one of the world's largest corporations as corporate welfare.


Amazon's new operations facility will span more than 820,000 square feet on the ground floor. Employees at the site will work alongside Amazon robotics technology to pick, pack and ship smaller customer items such as books, electronics, small household goods and toys.


In addition, Amazon will hire for staff in human resources, operations management, safety, security, finance and information technology.


Harvey, Hanna and Associates, developer of the Boxwood site, offered the following statement:


""Over the past two years, Harvey Hanna & Associates has proudly purchased the site, conducted extensive demolition, addressed remaining environmental impairment, and partnered with Dermody Properties  an accomplished, best-in-class national industrial developer  to reposition the site to be capable of attracting large numbers of high-quality jobs.The agreement also represents new progress for our vision to transform the Greater Newport area into a vibrant, transit-oriented area that includesdowntown mixed-use redevelopment; reactivation of the SEPTA passenger rail stop; and a new greenways walking and bicycle trail along the Christina River connecting Newport to the Jack Markell Trail and Wilmington Riverfront. This is an exciting time for New Castle County.""


""The First State was home to Amazon's first fulfillment center 23 years ago,"" said Ryan Smith, director of Amazon robotics fulfillment centers in North America. ""I'm proud to see the continued growth and investment in Delaware with our newest fulfillment center in Wilmington. Amazon has found an outstanding, passionate workforce, strong state and local support and incredible customers across the state. We look forward to creating 1,000 new, full-time jobs with industry-leading pay and benefits, starting on day one, in a safe, innovative and quality work environment. I know first-hand the opportunity and support network we provide employees for long-term, career success, and I'm excited to provide that same opportunity for thousands of current and future Amazonians.""


Employees start with a $15 an hour minimum wage. Full-time employees receive comprehensive benefits, including full medical, vision and dental insurance as well as a 401(k) with 50 percent company match, starting on day one.


""The Amazon location announcement says something about the state of our economy, but also about the spirit of our people in New Castle County,"" said County Executive Matt Meyer. ""When you have one of our largest commercial sites, one that hasn't created any jobs, barren for more than a decade, it speaks to the neighbors and the community here. Now we're going to have the retail operation of the future, creating more than 1,000 jobs, and we'll have a workforce that will deliver for them.""


In addition, Amazon has pledged to invest over $700 million to provide training for 100,000 U.S. employees for in-demand jobs. Programs will help Amazonians from all backgrounds access training to move into roles across the company's corporate offices, tech hubs, fulfillment centers, retails stores and transportation network or pursue career paths outside of Amazon.


""At Amazon, we want to help our employees get the skills they need for today's  and tomorrow's  most in-demand jobs,"" said Smith. ""All associates go through hours of safety training and ongoing coaching and have access to continuing education opportunities through Amazon's upskilling programs, such as Career Choice, in which the company will pre-pay up to 95 percent of tuition for courses related to in-demand fields, regardless of whether the skills are relevant to a career at Amazon. Since the program's launch, more than 25,000 employees have pursued degrees in game design and visual communications, nursing, IT programming and radiology, to name a few.""


Amazon says it has invested more than $2.5 billion in Delaware through its customer fulfillment infrastructure and compensation its employees.Amazon's investments in Delaware have contributed an additional $1 billion into the state's economy, and, using methodology developed by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, Amazon estimates its investments in the state have created additional 700-plus indirect jobs on top of the company's 2,500 direct hires.

3005019549,Amazon imposes sweeping warehouse reforms in response to coronavirus complaints,"In response to employee complaints and fears of coronavirus outbreaks at Amazon Fulfillment Centers, the online retailer has imposed more than 150 industry-wide safety protocols, including mandatory social distancing, mask wearing and cleanliness standards.

Chris Turner, general manager for Amazon’s Fulfillment Center/Robotics Building in the Riverside County community of Eastvale, led a tour of the warehouse Wednesday, May 20, to point out all the changes that have occurred since the government-mandated stay-at-home orders and lockdowns took effect.

At 885,000 square feet, four stories and more than 900 employees working per shift, Amazon’s Eastvale facility, referred to as LGB3, is the largest Amazon Fulfillment Center/Robotics Building on the West Coast per volume and head count, Turner said.

In the large break rooms, employees dine one per table, 6 feet apart. To reduce capacity, half the tables have been removed and set up outside the break room to create “open-air break rooms” for employees to also dine 6 feet apart.

					
				

“We created six open-air break rooms here,” Turner said during Wednesday’s tour. “This was definitely the hardest part to address.”

Restrooms are cleaned and sprayed with disinfectant about a dozen times a day, and the three main break rooms and five smaller satellite break rooms are cleaned and sprayed once a day, Turner said.

All employees now have their temperatures taken when entering the building and must wear face masks and gloves at all times. Once prohibited on the work floor, employees now may carry their cellphones in case of emergencies.

Face masks and hand sanitizer are available at distribution stations set up throughout the building.

For the most part, employees have adapted well to the changes and there haven’t been any complaints, Turner said.

					
				

Last month, the state Division of Occupational Safety and Health, or Cal/OSHA, received a complaint from workers at Amazon’s Fulfillment Center in Rialto, that social distancing was not being adhered to at the facility with 300 employees.

Cal/OSHA sent a notice to Scott Merrell, senior workforce, health and safety regulatory affairs manager for Amazon, on April 13 with a directive to investigate the allegations and, if found true, to notify Cal/OSHA within 14 days of all corrective measures taken or in progress.

Cal/OSHA received a response from Amazon on April 28 that is still under review, said Frank Polizzi, a spokesman for the California Department of Industrial Relations, in an email.

“We have responded to the complaint by CALOSHA regarding our site in Rialto … , and strongly believe the steps we have taken related to safety during Covid-19 are in compliance with all appropriate guidelines,” Amazon spokeswoman Eileen Hards said in an email.

In March, Amazon confirmed one employee at the Eastvale Fulfillment Center and one employee from the Moreno Valley Fulfillment Center had tested positive for the novel coronavirus.

Last month, about 350 Amazon warehouse employees called off work to participate in a nationwide protest alleging a lack of safety protocols during the COVID-19 pandemic.

On Wednesday, Amazon would not confirm how many employees at fulfillment centers in Southern California had tested positive for the novel coronavirus, but stressed it was doing everything it could to protect them and take the proper precautions in accordance guidelines from the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control.

“Our top concern is ensuring the health and safety of our employees, and we expect to invest approximately $4 billion from April to June on COVID-related initiatives to get products to customers and keep employees safe,” Hards said in a statement Wednesday.

“This includes spending more than $800 million in the first half of the year on COVID-19 safety measures, with investments in personal protective equipment, enhanced cleaning of our facilities, less efficient process paths that better allow for effective social distancing, higher wages for hourly teams, and developing our own COVID-19 testing capabilities.”

On Wednesday, state Assemblywoman Lorena Gonzalez introduced a bill, AB 3056, to prohibit Amazon from setting unreasonable quotas for employees. In a news release, Gonzalez alleged automated systems at Amazon warehouses generate warnings when too many “time-off tasks” occur during an employee’s shift, and an accumulation of too many warnings can result in a worker’s termination.

“In one facility in Riverside County, employees had to walk for seven minutes to the nearest restroom, leading many to forgo bathroom breaks rather than face penalties for the time-off-task and subsequent termination,” Gonzalez said in the release.

Her bill proposes that workers needing to leave their work stations for legitimate purposes, such as using the restroom or to get a drink of water, not be penalized and have that count as “time-off task.” Employers would face a $250 fine per employee for initial violations and $1,000 per employee for subsequent violations.

Despite the safety concerns at Amazon in recent months, the retail Goliath is still hiring in mass. Since February, more than 2,000 people have been hired at the Eastvale facility and more than 7,000 at facilities across the Inland Empire, Turner said.

Amazon also has assembled “safety committees” of roughly 80 employees at each of its sites. Distinguished by their green-and-yellow vests, their job is to make sure all employees are wearing their masks and social distancing and that face masks and hand sanitizer are well stocked at all stations.

Additionally, Amazon now offers an app employees can download to their phones and use to clock in and out for work.

3004941840,"Amazon Is Now Selling Swimsuits For Your Dog, Because Why Not?","Well, this is definitely a first. It looks like no one is safe from 'Bikini Body' season after Amazon has decided to start selling dog swimsuits! Yes, because what's fashion without a pair of the latest high model swim trunks for your pupper.

I have to admit, these Kove Mate Dog Swim Trunks are pretty adorable, and what's even better is that they are made out of recycled water bottles. The brand also has matching trunks for Dad, because you know, who doesn't want to match with their best friend while sitting near the pool.

The trunks are currently being sold for $25 on Amazon prime and come in sage green with black stripes and cyan blue. Which is great because everyone likes to have options. The suits are 93 percent Repreve recycled polyester and 7 percent spandex, just in case they overdid it on the yummy treats during the winter. The swim trunks come in small, medium, and large.

[caption id=""attachment_897919"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""443""] Amazon[/caption]

[buy_now link=""https://amzn.to/2The6N8""]

Each trunk is made out of eight plastic bottles, which is pretty amazing if you ask me. Over one million plastic bottles are sold every 60 seconds, and 91 percent of plastic is not recyclable. So yeah, feel good knowing you are making a difference when purchasing them. The material also apparently dries quickly, so it's convenient for those who are worried their pup will wet their car after a quick swim.

Why exactly do these exist? Honestly, I have no idea, I was roaming around Amazon trying to find a bathing suit for myself and boom, I saw these amazing but quite confusing swim trunks. I mean, would I buy one for my pup?

[caption id=""attachment_897920"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""471""] Amazon[/caption]

HELL YEAH, I would. Catch me buying two in every color because, duh. So far, there has only been one review on Amazon, but the user gave it a five-star rating, and even provided a picture of her dog! That pup looks very confused but let me tell you, he is rocking them!

I really love Amazon, you can find anything and everything. Keep doing what you're doing Amazon, we live for you.

Apple and Google on Wednesday released long-awaited smartphone technology to automatically notify people if they might have been exposed to the coronavirus

Apple and Google on Wednesday released long-awaited smartphone technology to automatically notify people if they might have been exposed to the coronavirus.

The companies said 22 countries and several U.S. states are already planning to build voluntary phone apps using their software. It relies on Bluetooth wireless technology to detect when someone who downloaded the app has spent time near another app user who later tests positive for the virus.

Many governments have already tried, mostly unsuccessfully, to roll out their own phone apps to fight the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. Many of those apps have encountered technical problems on Apple and Android phones and         haven't been widely adopted. They often use GPS to track people’s location, which Apple and Google are banning from their new tool because of privacy and accuracy concerns.

Public health agencies from Germany to the states of Alabama and South Carolina have been waiting to use the Apple-Google model, while other governments have said the tech giants' privacy restrictions will be a hindrance because public health workers will have no access to the data.

The companies said they're not trying to replace contact tracing, a pillar of infection control that involves trained public health workers reaching out to people who may have been exposed to an infected person. But they said their automatic “exposure notification” system can augment that process and slow the spread of COVID-19 by virus carriers who are interacting with strangers and aren't yet showing symptoms. 

The identity of app users will be protected by encryption and anonymous identifier beacons that change frequently.

“User adoption is key to success and we believe that these strong privacy protections are also the best way to encourage use of these apps,” the companies said in a joint statement Wednesday.

The statement Wednesday also included remarks from state officials in North Dakota, Alabama and South Carolina signaling that they plan to use it.

""We invite other states to join us in leveraging smartphone technologies to strengthen existing contact tracing efforts, which are critical to getting communities and economies back up and running,” said North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, a Republican.

North Dakota had already launched a location-tracking app that about 4% of state residents are using, higher than other U.S. states with similar apps but falling far short of the participation rate that experts say is needed to make such technology useful. 

Tim Brookins, the CEO of ProudCrowd, a startup that developed North Dakota's app, said Wednesday that North Dakotans will now be asked to download two complementary apps — his model, to help public health workers track where COVID-19 patients have been, and the Apple-Google model, to privately notify people who might have been exposed to the virus.",en,neutral,0.585249,neutral,0.689168,"['Google', 'Apple']","['North Dakota', 'smartphone', 'CEO', 'Bluetooth', 'Alabama', 'infection control', 'encryption', 'GPS', 'wireless', 'Android', 'Public health', 'public health', 'Republican', 'privacy', 'virus', 'Google', 'pandemic', 'Germany', 'COVID-19', 'coronavirus', 'South Carolina', 'Apple', 'U.S', 'By', 'Doug Burgum', 'Tim Brookins', 'AP', '', 'Share', 'FacebookEmail', 'ProudCrowd']","['technology', 'release', 'pandemic', 'Google', 'Apple', 'apps', 'North Dakota', 'public health', 'Public health', 'people', 'North', 'user', 'Dakota', 'privacy', 'health', 'Public', 'companies', 'COVID-19', 'virus', 'phone', 'model', 'Wednesday', 'smartphone', 'CEO', 'Bluetooth', 'Alabama', 'infection control', 'encryption', 'GPS', 'wireless', 'Android', 'Republican', 'Germany', 'coronavirus', 'South Carolina']","['#AppleInc', '#Google', '#PublicHealth', '#NorthDakota', '#Pandemic', '#Smartphone', '#Virus', '#Privacy', '#Coronavirus', '#Alabama', '#SouthCarolina', '#Bluetooth', '#Wireless', '#Android', '#GPS', '#GlobalPositioningSystem', '#Germany', '#InfectionControl', '#Encryption', '#RepublicanParty', '#CEO', '#ChiefExecutiveOfficer']",19,15,523,3213,2020-05-20 17:18:45+00:00,ABC News,"{'avatar_url': None, 'id': 1281323, 'name': ""Matt O'brien""}","{'sentences': ['Apple, Google release technology for pandemic apps\n'

Apple and Google have released long-awaited smartphone technology to automatically notify people if they might have been exposed to the coronavirus

Apple and Google on Wednesday released long-awaited smartphone technology to automatically notify people if they might have been exposed to the coronavirus.

The companies said 22 countries and several U.S. states are already planning to build voluntary phone apps using their software. It relies on Bluetooth wireless technology to detect when someone who downloaded the app has spent time near another app user who later tests positive for the virus.

Many governments         have already tried, mostly unsuccessfully, to roll out their own phone apps to fight the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. Many of those apps have encountered technical problems on Apple and Android phones and         haven't been widely adopted. They often use GPS to track people’s location, which Apple and Google are banning from their new tool because of privacy and accuracy concerns.

Public health agencies         from Germany to the states of Alabama and South Carolina have been waiting to use the Apple-Google model, while other governments have said the tech giants' privacy restrictions will be a hindrance because public health workers will have no access to the data.

The companies said they're not trying to replace contact tracing, a pillar of infection control that involves trained public health workers reaching out to people who may have been exposed to an infected person. But they said their automatic “exposure notification” system can augment that process and slow the spread of COVID-19 by virus carriers who are interacting with strangers and aren't yet showing symptoms. 

The identity of app users will be protected by encryption and anonymous identifier beacons that change frequently.

“User adoption is key to success and we believe that these strong privacy protections are also the best way to encourage use of these apps,” the companies said in a joint statement Wednesday.

The companies said the new technology — the product of a         rare partnership between the rival tech giants — solves some of the main technical challenges that governments have had in building Bluetooth-based apps. It will make it easier for iPhones and Android phones to detect each other, work across national and regional borders and fix some of the problems that led previous apps to quickly drain a phone’s battery.

The statement Wednesday also included remarks from state officials in North Dakota, Alabama and South Carolina signaling that they plan to use it.

""We invite other states to join us in leveraging smartphone technologies to strengthen existing contact tracing efforts, which are critical to getting communities and economies back up and running,” said North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, a Republican.

North Dakota had already launched a location-tracking app that about 4% of state residents are using, higher than other U.S. states with similar apps but falling far short of the participation rate that experts say is needed to make such technology useful. 

Tim Brookins, the CEO of ProudCrowd, a startup that developed North Dakota's app, said Wednesday that North Dakotans will now be asked to download two complementary apps — his model, to help public health workers track where COVID-19 patients have been, and the Apple-Google model, to privately notify people who might have been exposed to the virus.

Some privacy advocates have favored the Google-Apple approach because it offers more privacy and security. But others, including Ryan Calo, a law professor who co-directs the University of Washington's Tech Policy Lab, said he is concerned about its effectiveness if people get too many false alerts asking them to quarantine themselves. He said public health agencies would be better off being able to track location with careful safeguards.

Calo said Google and Apple have been more upfront about the limitations of their model, but he said he's still worried some governments will treat it as a substitute for crucial investments in free, widespread testing and hiring an army of human contact tracers.

3004863810,Google finally has dark mode: Here’s how to activate it on iOS and Android,"For the last several years both Android and iOS have supported system-wide dark modes. The modes turn all the white or bright UI elements black, or “dark,” hence its name. Dark modes have been hugely popular with users because they can conserve battery life on smartphones with OLED displays . And they just look cool.

But while iOS and Android have had system-wide dark modes for a while now, it’s been up to third-party developers to support dark modes in their apps, with some devs having added the capabilities as soon as the operating systems supported them, while others have taken their time.

One of the biggest laggards, surprisingly, is Google, which makes Android. But as of this week, the primary Google app on Android and iOS will finally support dark mode (many of Google’s other apps have already been updated to support dark mode).

So, how do you enable dark mode in the primary Google app? First, make sure you have the latest version of the app downloaded to your phone, then:

The employees are needed to for picking and packing orders, receiving and stowing products, and the loading and unloading of trucks at the 2.5 million-square-foot building that Amazon calls its “fulfillment center” at 10010 W. Geiger Blvd.

“We are thrilled to announce that Amazon is joining the Spokane community and that we’ll be hiring over 2,000 new associates,” Andy Parra, Director of Operations for the Spokane facility said in a news release. “We are absolutely committed to the health and well-being of our future associates and will do everything we can to ensure their safety throughout the hiring process taking COVID-19 precautions into consideration.” 

Employees will be hired at a $15-an-hour minimum wage including benefits that include health coverage, the company said. Amazon has moved as much of the hiring process online, but some of the hiring steps must be completed in person.

Job candidates must be 18 years or older and have a high school diploma or equivalent to be considered. All interested candidates can choose a shift preference and select an appointment time to attend an upcoming hiring event and orientation. 

As a result of the coronavirus pandemic, the company is also included several safety measures, including a requirement that applicants wear a mask, which Amazon will provide.

Amazon is asking any applicants to stay at home if they are living with someone who is COVID-19 positive; if they have a temperature above 100.4; if the have traveled to another country in the past 14 days; or if they are currently experiencing shortness of breath or a cough.

The company previously said that it hopes to open the fulfillment center by the middle of 2020 and could employ more than 3,000 workers during peak holiday hours.

3004953986,"Apple, Google release coronavirus-tracing software — but will it help?","The release incorporates feedback from hundreds of conversations with public health agencies, government officials, academics, nonprofits and and privacy experts. Public health authorities can customize the system and combine it with data that users input voluntarily, the companies said.

States including North Dakota and Alabama have already requested and received access to the tech tools, as have 22 countries outside the U.S., according to Apple and Google. Countries including Germany, Italy and Ireland — all of which will base their national apps on the companies’ technology — are expected to release their apps in the coming weeks.

Health experts say contact tracing is essential to slowing the illness' spread and allowing the economy to reopen safely, and U.S. states are pouring millions of dollars into hiring people to go about it in low-tech teams. The phone-based apps aim to supercharge the effort, but doubts are already emerging about the effectiveness of the Google-Apple initiative, in part because the companies are imposing privacy restrictions on the types of information that health agencies can collect.

For instance, the apps will be able to tell when a smartphone user has been near a person who has tested positive for the coronavirus — but won't track the locations where the infected person has been. In contrast, states such as North Dakota have deployed apps that use GPS location tracking, which they say could help identify geographic hotspots in sparsely populated areas.

On the other hand, some privacy restrictions may be necessary to win over a public skittish after years of complaints about Silicon Valley's use of people’s personal data. A recent Washington Post-University of Maryland poll found that nearly 60 percent of Americans could or would not use apps designed using Apple's and Google's technology. About 82 percent of Americans have smartphones, pollsters found.

“Either you have a system unlikely to help people navigate their world, to leave their house and feel safe, or you have privacy trade-offs,"" said University of Washington Law School professor Ryan Calo.

Meanwhile, some states like California already plan to use the technology, and North Dakota has said it will build a second app that complies with the companies' rules.

A similar debate has played out in Europe, where the big tech companies clashed with, and ultimately prevailed over, government leaders who were pursuing their own versions of contract tracing apps before largely conceding to the approach being pushed by Apple and Google.

The two companies have said that authorized public health agencies' contact-tracing apps can have access to the Apple-Google technology as long as they agree to the privacy restrictions. Apple and Google have also suggested that countries should deploy just one app each to increase user adoption, but the companies added they will work with state and regional governments as well.

The two companies have a lot of leverage because, together, they control the underlying software used on almost all smartphones. That means apps that work Apple's and Google's technology would have a greater chance of seeing widespread adoption — a critical factor in whether any phone-based tracing effort succeeds.




POLITICO NEWSLETTERS


Technology news from Washington and Silicon Valley — weekday mornings, in your inbox.







The software they have developed taps into a smartphone’s Bluetooth signals and records when two devices come into close proximity. If any of the people later test positive for coronavirus, they can choose to anonymously notify others whom they may have exposed to the illness in the past two weeks.

The technology has also been developed to allow Android and iPhone devices to communicate with one another and to do so without devouring the smartphone's battery life, factors also seen as critical to the apps working as public health officials hope.

Apple and Google have stood firm on not allowing apps that use their software to collect location data, and the technology is designed so that neither company will have access to patients’ identities or sensitive health information. Information about who has come into contact with a specific person will be stored only in the person's phone, not in a central database. And people will have to consent both to using the apps and to sharing their coronavirus diagnoses.

Meanwhile, Democratic and Republican lawmakers have introduced privacy legislation to prevent app-makers from misusing patient data.

3004860808,Google finally has dark mode: Here’s how to activate it on iOS and Android,"For the last several years both Android and iOS have supported system-wide dark modes. The modes turn all the white or bright UI elements black, or “dark,” hence its name. Dark modes have been hugely popular with users because they can conserve battery life on smartphones with OLED displays . And they just look cool.

But while iOS and Android have had system-wide dark modes for a while now, it’s been up to third-party developers to support dark modes in their apps, with some devs having added the capabilities as soon as the OSes supported them, while other’s have taken their time.

One of the biggest laggards, surprisingly, is Google, which makes Android. But as of this week, the primary Google app on Android and iOS will finally support dark mode (many of Google’s other apps have already been updated to support dark mode).

3004940477,"Apple, Google release technology for pandemic apps","Apple and Google on Wednesday released long-awaited smartphone technology to automatically notify people if they might have been exposed to the coronavirus.

The companies said 22 countries and several U.S. states are already planning to build voluntary phone apps using their software. It relies on Bluetooth wireless technology to detect when someone who downloaded the app has spent time near another app user who later tests positive for the virus.

Many governments have already tried, mostly unsuccessfully, to roll out their own phone apps to fight the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. Many of those apps have encountered technical problems on Apple and Android phones and haven’t been widely adopted. They often use GPS to track people’s location, which Apple and Google are banning from their new tool because of privacy and accuracy concerns.

Public health agencies from Germany to the states of Alabama and South Carolina have been waiting to use the Apple-Google model, while other governments have said the tech giants’ privacy restrictions will be a hindrance because public health workers will have no access to the data.

The companies said they’re not trying to replace contact tracing, a pillar of infection control that involves trained public health workers reaching out to people who may have been exposed to an infected person. But they said their automatic “exposure notification” system can augment that process and slow the spread of COVID-19 by virus carriers who are interacting with strangers and aren’t yet showing symptoms.

The identity of app users will be protected by encryption and anonymous identifier beacons that change frequently.

“User adoption is key to success and we believe that these strong privacy protections are also the best way to encourage use of these apps,” the companies said in a joint statement Wednesday.

The statement Wednesday also included remarks from state officials in North Dakota, Alabama and South Carolina signaling that they plan to use it.

“We invite other states to join us in leveraging smartphone technologies to strengthen existing contact tracing efforts, which are critical to getting communities and economies back up and running,” said North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, a Republican.

North Dakota had already launched a location-tracking app that about 4% of state residents are using, higher than other U.S. states with similar apps but falling far short of the participation rate that experts say is needed to make such technology useful.

3004968846,"Apple, Google release technology for coronavirus exposure apps","Public health agencies from Germany to the states of Alabama and South Carolina have been waiting to use the Apple-Google model for phone apps.

    
                            
Apple and Google on Wednesday released long-awaited smartphone technology to automatically notify people if they might have been exposed to the coronavirus.
                                            

                    
The companies said 22 countries and several U.S. states are already planning to build voluntary phone apps using their software. It relies on Bluetooth wireless technology to detect when someone who downloaded the app has spent time near another app user who later tests positive for the virus.
                                            

                        
                    
Many governments have already tried, mostly unsuccessfully, to roll out their own phone apps to fight the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. Many of those apps have encountered technical problems on Apple and Android phones and haven't been widely adopted. They often use GPS to track people’s location, which Apple and Google are banning from their new tool because of privacy and accuracy concerns.
                                            

                    
Public health agencies from Germany to the states of Alabama and South Carolina have been waiting to use the Apple-Google model, while other governments have said the tech giants' privacy restrictions will be a hindrance because public health workers will have no access to the data.
                                            

                    
The companies said they're not trying to replace contact tracing, a pillar of infection control that involves trained public health workers reaching out to people who may have been exposed to an infected person. But they said their automatic “exposure notification” system can augment that process and slow the spread of COVID-19 by virus carriers who are interacting with strangers and aren't yet showing symptoms.
                                            

                    
The identity of app users will be protected by encryption and anonymous identifier beacons that change frequently.
                                            

                    
“User adoption is key to success and we believe that these strong privacy protections are also the best way to encourage use of these apps,” the companies said in a joint statement Wednesday.
                                            

                    
                    
                                
                    
The companies said the new technology — the product of a rare partnership between the rival tech giants — solves some of the main technical challenges that governments have had in building Bluetooth-based apps. It will make it easier for iPhones and Android phones to detect each other, work across national and regional borders and fix some of the problems that led previous apps to quickly drain a phone’s battery.
                                            

                    
The statement Wednesday also included remarks from state officials in North Dakota, Alabama and South Carolina signaling that they plan to use it.
                                            

                                
                    
""We invite other states to join us in leveraging smartphone technologies to strengthen existing contact tracing efforts, which are critical to getting communities and economies back up and running,” said North Dakota Gov.

3004944124,"Apple, Google release technology for pandemic apps","Matt O'Brien, Associated Press
            Published 1:17 p.m. ET May 20, 2020
        
Apple and Google on Wednesday released long-awaited smartphone technology to automatically notify people if they might have been exposed to the coronavirus.
The companies said 22 countries and several U.S. states are already planning to build voluntary phone apps using their software. It relies on Bluetooth wireless technology to detect when someone who downloaded the app has spent time near another app user who later tests positive for the virus.
Many governments have already tried, mostly unsuccessfully, to roll out their own phone apps to fight the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. Many of those apps have encountered technical problems on Apple and Android phones and haven't been widely adopted. They often use GPS to track people’s location, which Apple and Google are banning from their new tool because of privacy and accuracy concerns.

Public health agencies from Germany to the states of Alabama and South Carolina have been waiting to use the Apple-Google model, while other governments have said the tech giants' privacy restrictions will be a hindrance because public health workers will have no access to the data.
The companies said they're not trying to replace contact tracing, a pillar of infection control that involves trained public health workers reaching out to people who may have been exposed to an infected person. But they said their automatic “exposure notification” system can augment that process and slow the spread of COVID-19 by virus carriers who are interacting with strangers and aren't yet showing symptoms.
The identity of app users will be protected by encryption and anonymous identifier beacons that change frequently.
“User adoption is key to success and we believe that these strong privacy protections are also the best way to encourage use of these apps,” the companies said in a joint statement Wednesday.
The statement Wednesday also included remarks from state officials in North Dakota, Alabama and South Carolina signaling that they plan to use it.
""We invite other states to join us in leveraging smartphone technologies to strengthen existing contact tracing efforts, which are critical to getting communities and economies back up and running,” said North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, a Republican.
North Dakota had already launched a location-tracking app that about 4% of state residents are using, higher than other U.S. states with similar apps but falling far short of the participation rate that experts say is needed to make such technology useful.

3004864185,Huawei Surprises Millions Of Users With Critical Google Replacement,"Sergei Karpukhin/TASS
 
  
 
Huawei is now in a race against time. Until last Friday, its mission was to keep government and enterprise users—as well 650 million active smartphone users—loyal to the brand while it fought the U.S. blacklist. Until last Friday, despite shrinking sales overseas—primarily due to the loss of Google, the company continued to post decent financials based on its performance at home.
 
And then last week hit. The U.S. celebrated the blacklist’s first anniversary by exponentially increasing the stakes, changing everything for Huawei. All flagship phones will be hit by Taiwan’s TSMC cutting off supplies—those sold at home and overseas. The key beneficiaries—somewhat ironically—may well be other Chinese smartphone vendors able to replicate Huawei’s successful recipe. 
 
MORE FROM FORBESFurious China Has Just 12-Months To Save Huawei After 'Crushing' Trump AttackBy Zak Doffman 
 
Huawei and its supporters in Beijing have around 12-months to find a compromise with Washington or a workable replacement for that silicon supply chain—after that, stockpiles will diminish. Huawei is taking the view that a compromise or workaround can and must be found. The alternative is too drastic to contemplate. This time, the use of the word “survival” is not melodramatic. 
 
And so to the company’s hastily rejigged HAS2020—its global analyst conference. There’s little surprise that, as management recoil from the shockwave of the latest U.S. beating, there has also been business as usual talk of new tech and impressive innovation stemming from the 15% of sales it commits to RD, and, of course, the continuing search for those elusive Google gap-fillers.
 
 
Piece by piece, we have seen Huawei build an ecosystem that it sees as a third-way alternative to Google’s full-fat Android and iOS. Last year, hopes were pinned to the most radical possible option, an entirely new, ground-up OS—but what was soon watered down into an expansion of the open-source version of Android that Huawei will not lose. What we did see, though, was a huge acceleration of Huawei Mobile Services (HMS), a swap-out for Google’s GMS, and the app ecosystem to go with it.
 
In recent weeks, we have seen a trail of confirmations around replacements for Google apps—like maps, and a revamped AppGallery to replace the Play Store. We have even seen Huawei talk up app security measures as a differentiator to Google, which has had issues with screening the millions of apps now on Play Store.
 
Back in March, just ahead of the P40 launch, I reported on pilot testing of two new Huawei apps, “Search” and “AppSearch,” both intended as replacements for Google functionality on Huawei phones. The first to replace core search itself—a major money-spinner for Google, the second to make it easy for users to search for and install popular apps, either from Huawei’s AppGallery or third-party stores.
 
Both these apps had their issues. The use of a Chinese search engine, subject to Beijing’s influence if not laws outside China, is clearly an issue. We have seen reports of how other such platforms might be subject to interference. We have also seen reports about China’s efforts to control the messages received overseas, and with its close ties to Huawei many will fear the worst.
 
 
  
  
  Huawei AppGallery
 
  
 
On the AppSearch front, the issues were more clearcut. it looks like a clever way to bypass U.S. restrictions in spirit if not the letter of the law. Many of the most popular apps are U.S. owned, and where they are not available on the AppGallery, there will be concerns raised about Huawei easing installation for users through the use of an official app on the AppGallery.
 
Back in March, AppSearch was reportedly being tested in Germany. The app’s landing page at the time said it was designed to help users install their favorite apps on Huawei smartphones, listing Facebook and WhatsApp as examples. Shortly after my report was published, Huawei revoked access to AppSearch and its publicity. An instructional YouTube video, posted by Huawei Germany, was also pulled.
 
Well now it’s back—the race against time is on. The renamed “Petal Search” combines both “Search” and “App Search into a single install. “Petal Search puts the world in the palm of your hand,” Huawei says, confirming that users can “search for your favorite phone apps with our state of the art technology.”
 
 
  

 
On the search front, Petal Search offers Huawei curated “daily weather forecasts and top news, live sports scores and schedules, video, image, and music searches,” as well as “financial news and stock market updates.” 
 
All that plus the ability to search for and install apps. The biggest issue post-blacklist has been that app installation and Google workarounds have intimidated regular users. The new Petal Search is intended to make everything official and assured. Search for an app like “Instagram” or “Facebook,” and the results will come complete with an install option. If the app is available on the AppGallery, then that’s where it comes from. If not, a third-party app store will be used instead. 
 
No word yet on the security measures to screen those applications coming from outside the AppGallery, and there are likely to be regional and national variances on what is available. What is clear, though, is that any suggestion that this might be an issue for Huawei in light of U.S. restrictions has diminished with escalating tensions. Huawei wants to ensure that as many as possible of its 650 million active smartphone users stick with the brand over the coming difficult months.
 
Meanwhile, Huawei’s primary domestic rival in overseas markets, Xiaomi, will be watching on from there sidelines. It has gladly picked up the baton to build from where Huawei left off. In its first quarter results, released today, the company reports more than 13% sales growth, building open its stellar end to last year. 
 
MORE FROM FORBESHuawei Loses Millions Of Users As Serious New Threat From China Gets RealBy Zak Doffman 
With international consumers having shown a willingness to buy Chinese phones and a lack of willingness to drop Google, Xiaomi is enviously placed. According to Xiaomi, overseas revenue for the quarter increased almost 49% year-on-year, “and for the first time, accounted for half of our total revenue.” These are Huawei-like results, and will be a genuine concern for the larger rival.
 
Unexpectedly, Huawei has now offered its users a viable quick-fix for the today problem—albeit nothing yet as to how the silicon issue might resolve. As the company deals with that challenge, its domestic rival has shown that those millions of international users might not wait around to see what happens.",en,neutral,0.754306,neutral,0.657402,"['Google', 'Huawei']","['smartphone', 'smartphones', 'TASS', 'Xiaomi', 'Mobile', 'Huawei', 'Washington', 'Facebook', 'Instagram', 'Taiwan', 'WhatsApp', 'Android', 'stock market', 'iOS', 'financial news', 'search engine', 'app store', 'palm', 'YouTube', 'TSMC', 'Chinese', 'China', 'silicon', 'Beijing', 'Google', 'clearcut', 'recoil', 'Germany', 'Play Store', 'ecosystem', 'flagship', 'U.S', 'RD', 'AppGallery', 'Huawei Germany', 'Sergei Karpukhin', 'AttackBy Zak Doffman', 'Zak Doffman', 'FORBESFurious China', 'Huawei Mobile Services', 'HMS', 'GMS', 'P40', 'Huawei’s AppGallery', 'Huawei AppGallery', 'AppSearch', 'Petal Search', 'App Search', 'On', 'FORBESHuawei Loses Millions Of Users']","['Users', 'Critical', 'Millions', 'Google', 'Surprises', 'Huawei', 'Replacement', 'Huawei apps', 'Google apps', 'users', 'issues', 'U.S.', 'apps', 'time', 'China', 'company', 'AppGallery', 'search', 'phones', 'smartphone', 'smartphones', 'TASS', 'Xiaomi', 'trail', 'Mobile', 'open-source', 'Washington', 'Facebook', 'Instagram', 'Taiwan', 'WhatsApp', 'Android', 'stock market', 'iOS', 'financial news', 'search engine', 'app store', 'palm', 'acceleration', 'YouTube', 'TSMC', 'Chinese', 'silicon', 'Beijing', 'clearcut', 'baton', 'recoil', 'Germany', 'Play Store', 'ecosystem', 'flagship']","['#Huawei', '#Google', '#China', '#Smartphone', '#Xiaomi', '#Beijing', '#Silicon', '#Ecosystem', '#Android', '#GooglePlay', '#Germany', '#Facebook', '#TASS', '#TASS', '#Flagship', '#Taiwan', '#TSMC', '#TSMC', '#Washington', '#Recoil', '#IOS', '#OpensourceModel', '#Acceleration', '#MobileAlabama', '#Trail', '#WebSearchEngine', '#Clearcutting', '#WhatsApp', '#YouTube', '#Arecaceae', '#FinancialNews', '#StockMarket', '#Instagram', '#AppStore', '#Baton']",51,52,1137,6743,2020-05-20 11:44:20+00:00,Forbes,"{'avatar_url': None, 'id': 942024, 'name': 'Zak Doffman'}","{'sentences': ['We have even seen Huawei talk up app security measures as a '

North Dakota had already launched a location-tracking app that about 4% of state residents are using, higher than other U.S. states with similar apps but falling far short of the participation rate that experts say is needed to make such technology useful.

Tim Brookins, the CEO of ProudCrowd, a startup that developed North Dakota's app, said Wednesday that North Dakotans will now be asked to download two complementary apps — his model, to help public health workers track where COVID-19 patients have been, and the Apple-Google model, to privately notify people who might have been exposed to the virus.

Some privacy advocates have favored the Google-Apple approach because it offers more privacy and security.

3005024964,Google and Apple Launch 'Exposure Notification' API to Notify of Potential Coronavirus Exposure,"Google and Apple recently launched its exposure notification API--which debuted originally as a joint contact-tracing software tool--to the public on May 21.

According to Techcrunch's latest report, Apple and Google renamed their innovation to an 'Exposure Notification System' to reflect its functionality more accurately.

The system is specifically designed to notify users of the potential exposure they can encounter from individuals who are confirmed with the coronavirus infection, but it will still preserve the privacy of individuals while identifying their location data and information.

Public health officials will now be allowed to use the API in apps released to the general public, with the help of the partners' new system. However, it was clarified that only beta versions of the API have been currently released.

The innovation will help the developers working on behalf of public health agencies to issue apps. However, it was emphasized that Apple and Google are not creating contact-tracing or exposure-notification apps.

The two companies said that access to the API has already been provided to many US states and 22 countries to support their development efforts, expecting that more can be added moving forward. Twenty-four briefings and tech talks were conducted by Google and Apple for epidemiologists, health officials, and app developers working on their behalf.

According to Techcrunch, a decentralized identifier system is used in the Exposure Notification API. It also uses randomly generated temporary keys developed on a user's device which are not linked to their specific info or identity.

Public health agencies can identify potential coronavirus exposure in terms of exposed distance and time using Google and Apple's API system. Public health authorities can also adjust other factors such as transmission risk according to their preferred standards.

Public health officials can now contact exposed individuals directly and provide them with the safety measures they should take based on the voluntarily submitted user data they have provided. Apple and Google have assured that privacy is an utmost consideration by making various improvements during the API's development.

Encrypting all Bluetooth metadata such as specific transmitting power and signal strength is included in the improvement of the system. The system can identify what type of device was used, providing a thin possibility of linking an individual with a specific device and using that as one identification factor.

However, the companies clarified that some apps being developed by public health officials for contact tracing which use geological info won't be allowed since seeking geolocation information permission from users is explicitly barred from the API system.

3004869337,Google launches Enhanced Safe Browsing to combat fleet-footed phishing sites,"Real-time URL checks designed to block phishing sites that dodged previous measures

An ‘enhanced protection’ mode added to Chrome’s Safe Browsing feature will provide more tailored safeguards against malicious websites and downloads.
Launched yesterday (May 19), Enhanced Safe Browsing will receive additional security data from Google’s browser in order to protect users against sophisticated phishing operations that exploit limitations in the feature’s blocklist API.
In a blog post, the Chrome Safe Browsing team said “security cannot be one-size-fits-all anymore” in the face of “increasingly sophisticated” web threats such as “malware campaigns directly targeting at-risk users”.
Blocklist API
Google Safe Browsing displays warnings to users when they attempt to access dangerous sites or download malicious files, and alerts webmasters when their websites have been compromised.
The technology discovers and adds thousands of unsafe sites to the blocklist API protocol each day.
Each time a user attempts to visit a website or download a file, Chrome checks the URL or file against a local list that is updated roughly every 30 minutes – a brief window which some phishing operators “slip through” by rapidly rotating domains.
‘Enhanced protection’ mode will provide “more proactive and tailored protections” based on users’ individual browsing history or threats they encounter, something lacking from the API.
“Google cannot determine the actual URL Chrome visited” based on information passed to the API, said the Safe Browsing team. “And thus by necessity the same verdict is returned regardless of the user’s situation”.
Enhanced Safe Browsing
If users opt into ‘Enhanced protection’ mode, Chrome will check uncommon URLs in real time to detect phishing websites.
The browser will also relay a small sample of pages and suspicious downloads to the Safe Browsing feature to aid threat discovery.
This data is temporarily linked to the user’s Google Account if they’re logged into Chrome – being anonymized after a “short period” – in order to “provide the most precise protection without unnecessary warnings” to the user’s situation “when an attack is detected against your browser or account”.
Google said additional protections in the development pipeline include tailored warnings for phishing sites and file downloads and cross-product alerts.

3004984159,"Director of 'God's Own Country' says distributor, not Amazon, censored gay sex scenes","Francis Lee, director of 2017 breakout British drama God’s Own Country, claims his film was censored since landing on Amazon Prime.

In a tweet posted Tuesday evening, Lee said the film, which explores the relationship between a farmer named Johnny (The Crown‘s Josh O’Connor) and a migrant worker named Gheorghe (Alec Secareanu), “appears to have been censored” on Amazon Prime in the U.S., and asked that followers and fans “not rent or buy on Amazon Prime” until it’s “investigated.”

The censored scenes are apparently gay sex scenes, and some commenters in Lee’s thread claimed they noticed the censorship in recent viewings, though not in older viewings.

An Amazon review from May 16 states: “The movie itself is a good story; I am just disappointed in Amazon Prime for editing out a certain scenes when they included it for Prime viewers. Shame on you for censorship.”

According to Deadline, a “source” explained that the film is a Prime Video Direct title, which means it’s uploaded by the distributor (Samuel Goldwyn Films) directly, and the sexual content might have affected its reach. The censored version has allegedly been removed from Amazon for Prime subscribers, but the original cut is available for purchase.

Lee tweeted an update Wednesday afternoon, confirming that the distributor censored the streaming version “without consultation,” not Amazon. He directed interested parties to rent the film on Amazon.

“The rental version of God’s Own Country on [Amazon Prime] is the correct version of my film,” he said, thanking Amazon for rectifying the situation.

We’ve reached out to Amazon for clarification.

                Apple, Google release technology for pandemic apps

                
                
                
                    
                

            

        

    



                                    

                                
            Apple and Google on Wednesday released long-awaited smartphone technology to automatically notify people if they might have been exposed to the coronavirus.


    
            The companies said 22 countries and several U.S. states are already planning to build voluntary phone apps using their software. It relies on Bluetooth wireless technology to detect when someone who downloaded the app has spent time near another app user who later tests positive for the virus.


    
                                

            
            Many governments have already tried, mostly unsuccessfully, to roll out their own phone apps to fight the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. Many of those apps have encountered technical problems on Apple and Android phones and haven't been widely adopted. They often use GPS to track people’s location, which Apple and Google are banning from their new tool because of privacy and accuracy concerns.


    
                                
                    
            
                                

            
            Public health agencies from Germany to the states of Alabama and South Carolina have been waiting to use the Apple-Google model, while other governments have said the tech giants' privacy restrictions will be a hindrance because public health workers will have no access to the data.


    
                                            
                    
            The companies said they're not trying to replace contact tracing, a pillar of infection control that involves trained public health workers reaching out to people who may have been exposed to an infected person. But they said their automatic “exposure notification” system can augment that process and slow the spread of COVID-19 by virus carriers who are interacting with strangers and aren't yet showing symptoms.


    
                                
                    
            
                                
                    
            
            The identity of app users will be protected by encryption and anonymous identifier beacons that change frequently.


    
            “User adoption is key to success and we believe that these strong privacy protections are also the best way to encourage use of these apps,” the companies said in a joint statement Wednesday.


    
                                            
                                
                            

                    
            The statement Wednesday also included remarks from state officials in North Dakota, Alabama and South Carolina signaling that they plan to use it.


    
            ""We invite other states to join us in leveraging smartphone technologies to strengthen existing contact tracing efforts, which are critical to getting communities and economies back up and running,” said North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, a Republican.


    
            North Dakota had already launched a location-tracking app that about 4% of state residents are using, higher than other U.S. states with similar apps but falling far short of the participation rate that experts say is needed to make such technology useful.


    
                                

            
            Tim Brookins, the CEO of ProudCrowd, a startup that developed North Dakota's app, said Wednesday that North Dakotans will now be asked to download two complementary apps — his model, to help public health workers track where COVID-19 patients have been, and the Apple-Google model, to privately notify people who might have been exposed to the virus.",en,neutral,0.585249,positive,0.9822299999999999,"['Google', 'Apple']","['North Dakota', 'smartphone', 'CEO', 'Bluetooth', 'Alabama', 'infection control', 'encryption', 'GPS', 'wireless', 'Android', 'Public health', 'public health', 'Republican', 'privacy', 'China', 'Beijing', 'virus', 'Google', 'pandemic', 'Germany', 'COVID-19', 'coronavirus', 'South Carolina', 'Apple', 'Women', 'U.S', ""Matt O'brien"", 'Mark Schiefelbein', 'Doug Burgum', 'Tim Brookins', 'Ap Technology Writer', 'AP', 'ProudCrowd']","['technology', 'release', 'pandemic', 'Google', 'Apple', 'apps', 'North Dakota', 'public health', 'Public health', 'North', 'user', 'Dakota', 'health', 'people', 'Public', 'privacy', 'companies', 'virus', 'Wednesday', 'COVID-19', 'infection', 'model', 'smartphone', 'CEO', 'Bluetooth', 'Alabama', 'infection control', 'encryption', 'GPS', 'wireless', 'Android', 'Republican', 'China', 'Beijing', 'Germany', 'PDT', 'coronavirus', 'South Carolina']","['#AppleInc', '#Virus', '#Google', '#Coronavirus', '#Pandemic', '#Beijing', '#China', '#PublicHealth', '#NorthDakota', '#Privacy', '#Smartphone', '#Alabama', '#SouthCarolina', '#PDT', '#PacificTimeZone', '#Bluetooth', '#Wireless', '#Android', '#GPS', '#GlobalPositioningSystem', '#Germany', '#InfectionControl', '#Encryption', '#RepublicanParty', '#CEO', '#ChiefExecutiveOfficer']",142,21,676,7703,2020-05-20 17:16:26+00:00,Seattle PI,"{'avatar_url': None, 'id': 1662681, 'name': ""By Matt O'brien""}","{'sentences': ['Apple, Google release technology for pandemic apps\n'

3005019398,"Joseph N. DiStefano: A thousand workers, many robots: Amazon confirms first phase of giant Del. warehouse","May 20--Amazon has confirmed some details of a much-expected new warehouse center at the former General Motors plant site just west of Wilmington.

On Tuesday, Amazon pledged ""more than 1,000 full-time jobs"" and a first-floor, robotics-heavy 820,000-square-foot operations center at the site, where developer Dermody Properties has filed plans to build as much as 3.8 million square feet, making it potentially larger than any current Amazon center.

Dermody built another center for Amazon near Bridgeport, Gloucester County, in 2018. Amazon also erected its first East Coast warehouse in New Castle, Del., in 1997 and added a larger facility in Middletown, Del., near the Maryland border, in 2012.

Delaware imposes a gross-receipts tax on retailers such as Amazon, but that tax is suspended for sales from newly built facilities such as the new warehouse. (More on Delaware property tax, sales-receipts tax and cash incentives for the new Amazon plant in my March 2 column here.)

Amazon's existing Delaware facilities employ 2,500, plus more during the Christmas shipping season. The company also has concentrations of large warehouses in central Pennsylvania and the Lehigh Valley.

In February, Delaware officials agreed to pay Amazon $4.5 million,  an unusually large up-front grant, despite objections from labor-union representative and state Sen. John Kowalko (D., Newark), if it moved to the site. The company's profits totaled $1 billion a month last year, record show.

""Delaware officials and regulatory agencies have been very responsive to our needs,"" which made it possible to attract Amazon, said Dermody partner Jeffrey A. Zygler in a statement. Dermody plans to spend at least $200 million at the site while Amazon plans to spend $50 million on automation equipment.

Gov. John Carney said in a statement that Amazon was welcome to the site, which has been vacant since the car plant closed in 2009. A federal- and state-subsidized plan to build Fisker electric cars there, backed by then-Vice President Joe Biden, who lives in nearby Greenville, fizzled when that company went bankrupt. The plant was demolished by local developer Harvey, Hanna & Associates last year.

At the hearing for the grant, Amazon officials testified that they planned to pay workers $15 an hour, and a smaller group of managers $32 an hour. The base wage at the GM plant when it closed a decade ago was $26 an hour.

According to an Amazon statement, workers at the Wilmington center ""will work alongside innovative Amazon robotics technology to pick, pack and ship smaller customer items such as books, electronics, small household goods and toys.""

Ryan Smith, director of Amazon robotics fulfillment centers in North America, said in a statement that workers get ""full medical, vision and dental insurance as well as a 401(k) with 50 percent company match"" and tuition aid, on top of their $15-an-hour wages.

            Apple and Google on Wednesday released long-awaited smartphone technology to automatically notify people if they might have been exposed to the coronavirus.


    
            The companies said 22 countries and several U.S. states are already planning to build voluntary phone apps using their software. It relies on Bluetooth wireless technology to detect when someone who downloaded the app has spent time near another app user who later tests positive for the virus.


    
                                

            
                                
                    
            
            Many governments have already tried, mostly unsuccessfully, to roll out their own phone apps to fight the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. Many of those apps have encountered technical problems on Apple and Android phones and haven't been widely adopted. They often use GPS to track people’s location, which Apple and Google are banning from their new tool because of privacy and accuracy concerns.


    
                                            
                    
            Public health agencies from Germany to the states of Alabama and South Carolina have been waiting to use the Apple-Google model, while other governments have said the tech giants' privacy restrictions will be a hindrance because public health workers will have no access to the data.


    
            The companies said they're not trying to replace contact tracing, a pillar of infection control that involves trained public health workers reaching out to people who may have been exposed to an infected person. But they said their automatic “exposure notification” system can augment that process and slow the spread of COVID-19 by virus carriers who are interacting with strangers and aren't yet showing symptoms.


    
                                
                    
            
            The identity of app users will be protected by encryption and anonymous identifier beacons that change frequently.


    
                                            
                                
                            

                    
            “User adoption is key to success and we believe that these strong privacy protections are also the best way to encourage use of these apps,” the companies said in a joint statement Wednesday.


    
            The companies said the new technology — the product of a rare partnership between the rival tech giants — solves some of the main technical challenges that governments have had in building Bluetooth-based apps. It will make it easier for iPhones and Android phones to detect each other, work across national and regional borders and fix some of the problems that led previous apps to quickly drain a phone’s battery.


    
                                

            
            The statement Wednesday also included remarks from state officials in North Dakota, Alabama and South Carolina signaling that they plan to use it.


    
            ""We invite other states to join us in leveraging smartphone technologies to strengthen existing contact tracing efforts, which are critical to getting communities and economies back up and running,” said North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, a Republican.


    
                                
                    
            
            North Dakota had already launched a location-tracking app that about 4% of state residents are using, higher than other U.S. states with similar apps but falling far short of the participation rate that experts say is needed to make such technology useful.


    
            Tim Brookins, the CEO of ProudCrowd, a startup that developed North Dakota's app, said Wednesday that North Dakotans will now be asked to download two complementary apps — his model, to help public health workers track where COVID-19 patients have been, and the Apple-Google model, to privately notify people who might have been exposed to the virus.",en,neutral,0.585249,positive,0.9822299999999999,"['Google', 'Apple']","['North Dakota', 'CDT', 'smartphone', 'CEO', 'Bluetooth', 'Alabama', 'infection control', 'encryption', 'GPS', 'wireless', 'Android', 'Public health', 'public health', 'Republican', 'battery', 'privacy', 'China', 'Beijing', 'virus', 'Google', 'pandemic', 'Germany', 'COVID-19', 'coronavirus', 'South Carolina', 'Apple', 'Women', 'U.S', 'iPhones', ""Matt O'brien"", 'Mark Schiefelbein', 'Doug Burgum', 'Tim Brookins', 'Ap Technology Writer', 'AP', 'ProudCrowd']","['technology', 'release', 'pandemic', 'Google', 'Apple', 'apps', 'phone apps', 'North Dakota', 'phone', 'North', 'Dakota', 'user', 'companies', 'Wednesday', 'health', 'people', 'privacy', 'Public', 'governments', 'virus', 'infection', 'CDT', 'smartphone', 'CEO', 'Bluetooth', 'Alabama', 'infection control', 'encryption', 'GPS', 'wireless', 'Android', 'Public health', 'public health', 'Republican', 'battery', 'China', 'Beijing', 'Germany', 'coronavirus', 'COVID-19', 'South Carolina']","['#AppleInc', '#Virus', '#Google', '#Coronavirus', '#Pandemic', '#Beijing', '#China', '#PublicHealth', '#NorthDakota', '#Privacy', '#Smartphone', '#Android', '#Alabama', '#SouthCarolina', '#CDT', '#CentralTimeZone', '#Bluetooth', '#Wireless', '#GPS', '#GlobalPositioningSystem', '#Germany', '#InfectionControl', '#Encryption', '#Battery', '#RepublicanParty', '#CEO', '#ChiefExecutiveOfficer']",142,23,746,8092,2020-05-20 17:49:14+00:00,San Antonio Express-News (TX),"{'avatar_url': None, 'id': 2077752, 'name': ""Matt O'brien,""}","{'sentences': ['Apple, Google release technology for pandemic apps\n'

Law360 (May 20, 2020, 10:29 PM EDT) -- Apple and Google released software Wednesday that could allow governments across the globe to help track the spread of COVID-19 with smartphone apps that would alert users who come in close contact with someone who tested positive for the novel coronavirus.The tech giants' digital tool, which has been embraced by state officials in Alabama, North Dakota and South Carolina and is being closely watched by privacy watchdogs, allows health authorities to build apps that use Bluetooth technology to notify users who come in close proximity to other app users who report positive COVID-19 tests.So far, officials from 22 countries on five continents — as well as an undisclosed number of U.S. states — have received access to the Apple/Google technology, which is designed to be used to implement of contact tracing, the process of tracking the spread of the coronavirus by tracing the movements of those who have tested positive, the companies say.Authorities in Alabama, North Dakota and South Carolina confirmed in public statements that they planned to use the tech giants' software to build exposure notification apps. Apple and Google declined to provide information Wednesday on what other governments were using the technology to roll out their own contact-tracing apps.Both companies have pledged that use of all apps built using their technology will be voluntary, with users given the choice to opt-in to both sharing their positive test results and being notified of possible exposure to the virus. Apple and Google say that they are also barring governments that use their software from collecting GPS location data, and that their software stores the logs of people with whom users have been in contact remotely on their personal devices, in a ""decentralized"" process that is out of health authorities' reach.The tech giants' focus on privacy has earned it earlyfrom some consumer watchdogs, and company representatives say they hope to convince users to trust them enough to use government apps running the Apple/Google software.""User adoption is key to success, and we believe that these strong privacy protections are also the best way to encourage use of these apps,"" the companies said in a joint statement on Wednesday.Some governments, including in the U.K.,the Apple/Google approach in favor of apps that store data on servers overseen by the government. U.K. officials have said that such a system allows authorities to analyze data in ways that are not possible under decentralized systems, making their version of the app more effective. That approach, however, has raised the heckles of some privacy lawyers.In the U.S., North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum said in a news release that the state would soon release the ""Care19 Exposure"" app built using the Apple/Google system, in a move ""reaching the greatest number of people in a way that protects their privacy.""South Carolina's app will be called ""SC-Safer-Together"" and is being built by the state's department of health and the Medical University of South Carolina, state officials said.And Alabama's public health department, the University of Alabama System and the University of Alabama at Birmingham are working together on their own version of the app, said Scott Harris , Alabama's State Health Officer, in a statement.--Editing by Michael Watanabe.

3004840122,"Amazon promises 1,000 jobs for a new warehouse near Joe Biden’s house in Delaware","Amazon has confirmed some details of a much-expected new warehouse center at the former General Motors plant site just west of Wilmington.

On Tuesday, Amazon pledged “more than 1,000 full-time jobs” and a first-floor, robotics-heavy 820,000-square-foot operations center at the site, where developer Dermody Properties has filed plans to build as much as 3.8 million square feet, making it potentially larger than any current Amazon center.

Dermody built another center for Amazon near Bridgeport, Gloucester County, in 2018. Amazon also erected its first East Coast warehouse in New Castle, Del., in 1997 and added a larger facility in Middletown, Del., near the Maryland border, in 2012.

Delaware imposes a gross-receipts tax on retailers such as Amazon, but that tax is suspended for sales from newly built facilities such as the new warehouse.

Amazon’s existing Delaware facilities employ 2,500, plus more during the Christmas shipping season. The company also has concentrations of large warehouses in central Pennsylvania and the Lehigh Valley.

In February, Delaware officials agreed to pay Amazon $4.5 million,  an unusually large up-front grant, despite objections from labor-union representative and state Sen. John Kowalko (D., Newark), if it moved to the site. The company’s profits totaled $1 billion a month last year, record show.

“Delaware officials and regulatory agencies have been very responsive to our needs,” which made it possible to attract Amazon, said Dermody partner Jeffrey A. Zygler in a statement. Dermody plans to spend at least $200 million at the site while Amazon plans to spend $50 million on automation equipment.

Gov. John Carney said in a statement that Amazon was welcome to the site, which has been vacant since the car plant closed in 2009. A federal- and state-subsidized plan to build Fisker electric cars there, backed by then-Vice President Joe Biden, who lives in nearby Greenville, fizzled when that company went bankrupt. The plant was demolished by local developer Harvey, Hanna & Associates last year.

At the hearing for the grant, Amazon officials testified that they planned to pay workers $15 an hour, and a smaller group of managers $32 an hour. The base wage at the GM plant when it closed a decade ago was $26 an hour.

According to an Amazon statement, workers at the Wilmington center “will work alongside innovative Amazon robotics technology to pick, pack and ship smaller customer items such as books, electronics, small household goods and toys.”

Ryan Smith, director of Amazon robotics fulfillment centers in North America, said in a statement that workers get “full medical, vision and dental insurance as well as a 401(k) with 50 percent company match"" and tuition aid, on top of their $15-an-hour wages.

3004957432,Apple and Google launch contact tracing API for COVID-19 exposure,"Apple and Google today rolled out their digital contact tracing technology that can be used by public health agencies to track COVID-19.

In early April, the two tech giants announced they were collaborating to build Bluetooth-based technology to aid in the fight against the COVID pandemic.

Apple and Google's exposure notification application programming interface (API) will now be available to states, public health agencies, and governments to build apps that will notify people via smartphone if they've come into contact with someone with the coronavirus.

It marks an unprecedented step for the two tech giants to collaborate on a high-tech approach to track coronavirus cases.

That API is available today through a new software update in the Android and iOS operating systems that the companies pushed out Wednesday.

""Over the last several weeks, our two companies have worked together, reaching out to public health officials, scientists, privacy groups and government leaders all over the world to get their input and guidance,"" Apple and Google said in a joint statement.

The companies point out that the technology they've built is not an app. ""Rather public health agencies will incorporate the API into their own apps that people install. Our technology is designed to make these apps work better,"" the companies said.

According to Apple and Google, each user gets to decide whether or not to opt-in to exposure notifications and the system does not collect or use location data from the device.

RELATED: Apple, Google team up on COVID-19 contact tracing via smartphone apps

If a person is diagnosed with COVID-19, it is up to them whether or not to report that in the public health app, the companies said.

""User adoption is key to success and we believe that these strong privacy protections are also the best way to encourage use of these apps,"" they said.

Apple and Google said some U.S. states and 22 countries would be using the software, but the companies declined to provide a list of all the government agencies using it, the Washington Post reported.

“North Dakota is excited to be among the first states in the nation to utilize the exposure notification technology built by Apple and Google to help keep our citizens safe,"" Doug Burgum, the Governor of North Dakota, said in a statement.

The use of digital contact tracing technology has raised privacy concerns. According to a recent poll from the Washington Post and the University of Maryland, more than half of Americans would not use a contact tracing app and similar tools from Google and Apple over privacy concerns.

A Kaiser Family Foundation Health Tracking poll in late April also found that about half of consumers said they were unwilling to download a contact tracing app.

In a statement issued April 10 when the collaboration was announced, Jennifer Granick, ACLU surveillance and cybersecurity counsel, said people will only trust these systems ""if they protect privacy, remain voluntary, and store data on an individual's device, not a centralized repository.""

""At the same time, we must be realistic that such contact tracing methods are likely to exclude many vulnerable members of society who lack access to technology and are already being disproportionately impacted by the pandemic,"" Granick said.

To their credit, Apple and Google have announced an approach that appears to mitigate the worst privacy and centralization risks, but there is still room for improvement, Granick said.

On Capitol Hill, members of Congress have introduced legislation aimed at protecting the data collected by digital contact tracing tools and other pandemic response efforts.

Earlier this month, a group of Republican senators led by Roger Wicker of Mississippi introduced the COVID-19 Consumer Data Protection Act to hold businesses accountable to consumers if they use personal data to fight the COVID-19 pandemic.

Last week, a group of Democrats led by Connecticut Senator Richard Blumenthal proposed a competing bill to set strong and enforceable privacy and data security rights for health information.

3004963993,"Apple, Google release tech for coronavirus exposure alerts","Apple and Google on Wednesday released long-awaited smartphone technology to automatically notify people if they might have been exposed to the coronavirus.

The companies said 22 countries and several U.S. states are already planning to build voluntary phone apps using their software. It relies on Bluetooth wireless technology to detect when someone who downloaded the app has spent time near another app user who later tests positive for the virus.

Many governments have already tried, mostly unsuccessfully, to roll out their own phone apps to fight the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. Many of those apps have encountered technical problems on Apple and Android phones and haven't been widely adopted. They often use GPS to track people’s location, which Apple and Google are banning from their new tool because of privacy and accuracy concerns.

Public health agencies from Germany to the states of Alabama and South Carolina have been waiting to use the Apple-Google model, while other governments have said the tech giants' privacy restrictions will be a hindrance because public health workers will have no access to the data.

The companies said they're not trying to replace contact tracing, a pillar of infection control that involves trained public health workers reaching out to people who may have been exposed to an infected person. But they said their automatic “exposure notification” system can augment that process and slow the spread of COVID-19 by virus carriers who are interacting with strangers and aren't yet showing symptoms.

The identity of app users will be protected by encryption and anonymous identifier beacons that change frequently.

“User adoption is key to success and we believe that these strong privacy protections are also the best way to encourage use of these apps,” the companies said in a joint statement Wednesday.

The companies said the new technology — the product of a rare partnership between the rival tech giants — solves some of the main technical challenges that governments have had in building Bluetooth-based apps. It will make it easier for iPhones and Android phones to detect each other, work across national and regional borders and fix some of the problems that led previous apps to quickly drain a phone’s battery.

The statement Wednesday also included remarks from state officials in North Dakota, Alabama and South Carolina signaling that they plan to use it.

""We invite other states to join us in leveraging smartphone technologies to strengthen existing contact tracing efforts, which are critical to getting communities and economies back up and running,” said North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, a Republican.

North Dakota had already launched a location-tracking app that about 4% of state residents are using, higher than other U.S. states with similar apps but falling far short of the participation rate that experts say is needed to make such technology useful.

Tim Brookins, the CEO of ProudCrowd, a startup that developed North Dakota's app, said Wednesday that North Dakotans will now be asked to download two complementary apps — his model, to help public health workers track where COVID-19 patients have been, and the Apple-Google model, to privately notify people who might have been exposed to the virus.",en,neutral,0.88623,neutral,0.716962,"['Google', 'Apple']","['North Dakota', 'smartphone', 'CEO', 'Bluetooth', 'Alabama', 'infection control', 'encryption', 'GPS', 'wireless', 'Android', 'Public health', 'public health', 'Republican', 'battery', 'privacy', 'virus', 'Google', 'pandemic', 'Germany', 'COVID-19', 'coronavirus', 'South Carolina', 'Apple', 'U.S', 'iPhones', 'Doug Burgum', 'Tim Brookins', 'ProudCrowd']","['tech', 'release', 'coronavirus', 'Google', 'Apple', 'exposure', 'phone apps', 'North Dakota', 'apps', 'technology', 'phone', 'North', 'companies', 'people', 'user', 'Dakota', 'privacy', 'governments', 'health', 'Public', 'Wednesday', 'virus', 'COVID-19', 'smartphone', 'CEO', 'Bluetooth', 'Alabama', 'infection control', 'encryption', 'GPS', 'wireless', 'Android', 'Public health', 'public health', 'Republican', 'battery', 'pandemic', 'Germany', 'South Carolina']","['#AppleInc', '#PublicHealth', '#NorthDakota', '#Google', '#Virus', '#Privacy', '#Coronavirus', '#Smartphone', '#Android', '#Alabama', '#SouthCarolina', '#Bluetooth', '#Wireless', '#Pandemic', '#GPS', '#GlobalPositioningSystem', '#Germany', '#InfectionControl', '#Encryption', '#Battery', '#RepublicanParty', '#CEO', '#ChiefExecutiveOfficer']",12,17,539,3289,2020-05-20 19:26:00+00:00,Press Democrat,"{'avatar_url': None, 'id': 2026002, 'name': 'Matt O'}","{'sentences': ['Public health agencies from Germany to the states of Alabama '

3005000943,"Apple, Google release technology for pandemic apps","Apple and Google on Wednesday released long-awaited smartphone technology to automatically notify people if they might have been exposed to the coronavirus.

The companies said 22 countries and several U.S. states are already planning to build voluntary phone apps using their software. It relies on Bluetooth wireless technology to detect when someone who downloaded the app has spent time near another app user who later tests positive for the virus.

Many governments have already tried, mostly unsuccessfully, to roll out their own phone apps to fight the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. Many of those apps have encountered technical problems on Apple and Android phones and haven't been widely adopted. They often use GPS to track people’s location, which Apple and Google are banning from their new tool because of privacy and accuracy concerns.

Public health agencies from Germany to the states of Alabama and South Carolina have been waiting to use the Apple-Google model, while other governments have said the tech giants' privacy restrictions will be a hindrance because public health workers will have no access to the data.

The companies said they're not trying to replace contact tracing, a pillar of infection control that involves trained public health workers reaching out to people who may have been exposed to an infected person. But they said their automatic “exposure notification” system can augment that process and slow the spread of COVID-19 by virus carriers who are interacting with strangers and aren't yet showing symptoms.

3004947223,Apple and Google’s covid tracing tech has been released to 22 countries,"Contact tracing—tracking down those who may have been exposed to an infectious person—is an important and proven strategy that scientists have used to successfully fight outbreaks ranging from Ebola to HIV. In the last few months, many countries have been working to use various technologies, including mobile phone apps, to try to keep up with the scale and speed of the pandemic. 
  Over two dozen countries have already released their own contact tracing apps, but the Apple-Google release is expected to dramatically accelerate the process: their partnership means almost every smartphone worldwide will be able to detect each other and share information about potential exposure to the disease. Countries developing their own systems have run into both technical and civil liberties problems that the Silicon Valley project hopes to address.
  Scale matters
  Apple and Google said that 22 countries on five continents, as well as several American states, are being granted access to the API today. There are billions of people inside the participating countries but some of the notable omissions include France, which has locked horns with the tech companies over how their API works, and the United Kingdom, which is still figuring out if it will use the Apple-Google system in its own efforts.
  This technology has provided an illustration of the power and reach of Silicon Valley during a global crisis. Even as authorities in Europe, Asia, and North America pushed Apple and Google to allow location tracking or to build a centralized system, the companies played hardball and won. They built a privacy-first decentralized tracing system that requires multiple layers of consent, uses Bluetooth signals instead of location tracking, and is intended to be more reliable for people with older phones.
  “What we’ve built is not an app — rather public health agencies will incorporate the API into their own apps that people install,” Apple and Google said in a statement today. “Our technology is designed to make these apps work better. Each user gets to decide whether or not to opt-in to exposure notifications; the system does not collect or use location from the device; and if a person is diagnosed with covid-19, it is up to them whether or not to report that in the public health app. User adoption is key to success and we believe that these strong privacy protections are also the best way to encourage use of these apps.”
  Both companies say that as the pandemic ends in different countries, they will shut the tracing technology down.
  Apps may help tackle the scale of the pandemic and be part of a process for re-opening economies around the world, but epidemiologists and technologists broadly agree that there is no way apps can solve or even lead on this problem alone. Contact tracing typically requires real human beings to do much of the hard work. Experts say America will need over 100,000 such tracers for the effort.",en,neutral,0.8171729999999999,neutral,0.697008,"['Google', 'Apple']","['smartphone', 'North America', 'France', 'Bluetooth', 'Ebola', 'Europe', 'Silicon Valley', 'mobile phone', 'Asia', 'API', 'horns', 'public health', 'HIV', 'privacy', 'civil liberties', 'Google', 'pandemic', 'United Kingdom', 'covid-19', 'epidemiologists', 'Apple', 'America', 'Scale', 'Apps']","['covid', 'Google', 'tech', 'Apple', 'countries', 'apps', 'systems', 'technologies', 'companies', 'location', 'people', 'Contact', 'America', 'scale', 'smartphone', 'North America', 'France', 'Bluetooth', 'Ebola', 'Europe', 'Silicon Valley', 'mobile phone', 'Asia', 'API', 'horns', 'public health', 'HIV', 'privacy', 'civil liberties', 'pandemic', 'United Kingdom', 'covid-19', 'epidemiologists']","['#AppleInc', '#Google', '#Pandemic', '#API', '#ApplicationProgrammingInterface', '#SiliconValley', '#PublicHealth', '#EbolaVirusDisease', '#HIV', '#HIV', '#MobilePhone', '#Smartphone', '#CivilLiberties', '#France', '#FrenchHorn', '#UnitedKingdom', '#Europe', '#Asia', '#NorthAmerica', '#Bluetooth', '#Privacy', '#Epidemiology']",8,17,496,2951,2020-05-20 17:39:02+00:00,MIT Technology Review,"{'avatar_url': None, 'id': 2459158, 'name': ""Patrick O'neill""}","{'sentences': ['In the last few months, many countries have been working to '

3005015430,Apple and Google clash with health officials on COVID-19 contact tracing,"Despite early excitement, virus-tracing apps built by Apple and Google are likely useless, according to health officials. CNET senior producer Dan Patterson joined CBSN to talk about why this once promising technology now looks to be a failure.

In April, Apple and Google announced a joint plan to help trace the spread of COVID-19 by alerting users when they apparently came into contact with people who were positive. These applications were rolled out by state and local agencies, but subsequent operating system updates fall under the domain of the tech companies, where Patterson said the problem is. ""The Bluetooth capabilities of these applications and operating system updates aren't up to speed to the degree that Apple and Google initially claimed,"" he told CBSN's Reena Ninan.

The limited capabilities of these app updates are due to restrictions placed by these tech companies on developers which are not uncommon. ""These restrictions are in place to protect these companies' business models as well as the technical foundations of the operating systems,"" Patterson explained.

""They do have to be very careful in what they reveal in their own technical specifications and what they allow developers to access because once you allow certain parts of code to be accessed, you can't put the genie back in the bottle,"" Patterson added.

Updating issues aside, another problem stems from Apple and Google's reluctance to share this private health data with local, state and federal agencies. This struggle between tech and government comes at a time when public trust in both is at an all time low. ""You can imagine how this particular standoff illustrates the delicate balance between public safety on one and and public privacy on the other hand,"" Patterson said. ""Apple and Google want to protect the privacy of their users.""

Without a concise policy from the government, the tech companies are left to make decisions about the implications of the data they collect. ""These companies have to effectively create policy every time they make decisions about privacy. On the one hand they indicated that they do want to be as helpful as possible but on the other hand they have to protect the privacy of their users,"" Patterson said.

Without the full consent of data sharing from these tech companies, Patterson said it remains to be seen whether or not these apps can be effectively used for contact tracing. ""It will be challenging without these OS and applications having full access to data and sharing,"" he said.",en,neutral,0.9006569999999999,negative,0.766545,"['Google', 'Apple', 'COVID-19']","['genie', 'Bluetooth', 'The limited', 'operating system', 'public safety', 'privacy', 'Google', 'COVID-19', 'CNET', 'Apple', 'Dan Patterson', 'Patterson', 'Reena Ninan', 'CBSN', 'Updating', 'OS']","['health', 'officials', 'clash', 'Google', 'COVID-19', 'Apple', 'contact', 'tech companies', 'Patterson', 'tech', 'companies', 'applications', 'data', 'users', 'apps', 'CBSN', 'system', 'updates', 'access', 'time', 'genie', 'Bluetooth', 'The limited', 'operating system', 'public safety', 'privacy', 'CNET']","['#AppleInc', '#Google', '#Privacy', '#OperatingSystem', '#CNET', '#CNET', '#Bluetooth', '#TheLimited', '#Jinn', '#PublicSecurity']",7,17,426,2528,2020-05-21 00:52:43+00:00,CBS News,"{'avatar_url': None, 'id': 2571223, 'name': 'Jenn Leser'}","{'sentences': ['These applications were rolled out by state and local '

3004973070,"Apple, Google release template for COVID-19 contact tracing apps","Apple and Google on Wednesday released the first phase of a template that would allow software developers to build apps to assist public health authorities in tracking the spread of COVID-19.

Apple and Google executives told reporters that they had refined several features of the template after extensive consultations with public health authorities, privacy advocates, academics and government agencies from around the world. More refinements could be added in later phases through updates, they said.

The Bluetooth-based design would depend not only on voluntary download of the apps by users around the world but also require express consent from users to report a positive diagnosis for COVID-19 through the app. The design also would only allow those apps that have been built by or on behalf of public health authorities, the companies said.

The template, called Exposure Notification API, is being rolled out to iPhone and Android users in the form of a software update, both companies said.

3004956488,Apple and Google officially launch Exposure Notifications to fight COVID-19,"Today, Apple and Google have announced that they are making their Exposure Notifications technology available to public health agencies across the world.

In a joint statement, the companies announced that the API, which health agencies can use to incorporate the technology into their apps, is now available to developers on both iOS and Android.

Apple and Google stress that users have the option to opt-in to Exposure Notifications, the technology does not track their location, and that it is up to the individual to report potential exposure to the public health app they may be using. For iPhone owners, users must update to iOS 13.5 in order to have access to Exposure Notifications. Android users will receive the update automatically through Google Play Services.

They also note that widespread user adoption of this technology is critical to its success and both companies believe that the privacy-centric focus of their technology will accomplish that task.

You can read the full statement from Apple and Google below:


One of the most effective techniques that public health officials have used during outbreaks is called contact tracing. Through this approach, public health officials contact, test, treat and advise people who may have been exposed to an affected person. One new element of contact tracing is Exposure Notifications: using privacy-preserving digital technology to tell someone they may have been exposed to the virus. Exposure Notification has the specific goal of rapid notification, which is especially important to slowing the spread of the disease with a virus that can be spread asymptomatically.

To help, Apple and Google cooperated to build Exposure Notifications technology that will enable apps created by public health agencies to work more accurately, reliably and effectively across both Android phones and iPhones. Over the last several weeks, our two companies have worked together, reaching out to public health officials scientists, privacy groups and government leaders all over the world to get their input and guidance.

Starting today, our Exposure Notifications technology is available to public health agencies on both iOS and Android. What we've built is not an app — rather public health agencies will incorporate the API into their own apps that people install. Our technology is designed to make these apps work better. Each user gets to decide whether or not to opt-in to Exposure Notifications; the system does not collect or use location from the device; and if a person is diagnosed with COVID-19, it is up to them whether or not to report that in the public health app. User adoption is key to success and we believe that these strong privacy protections are also the best way to encourage use of these apps.

If you love them too and decide to purchase through the links below, we may receive a commission. Pricing and availability are subject to change. 
Going down an Amazon product rabbit hole, you can find just about anything. There’s some weird stuff out there, like this Nicolas Cage sequin pillow and this wine bra. But deep into the patio and outdoor category, you’ll find one major (OK, huge) item that you probably didn’t know existed on Amazon: tiny houses.
If you can’t get enough of the TV shows that are all about tiny house-living, you can actually live out your own tiny home dreams by purchasing one from Amazon. There’s one caveat however — the tiny houses come as a kit that you then have to build yourself. But if you’ve been looking for your next backyard DIY project, we’ve found it.
While you’d expect tiny homes to be a bit of a splurge purchase, Allwood’s 172-sqaure foot Solvalla Studio got so popular after customers found it on the site in May 2019 that it sold out in less than a week.
Right now, Allwood is the primary brand that’s selling these tiny house kits on Amazon, and unsurprisingly, they aren’t cheap. One the most affordable options is one that’s 113-square feet going for a mere $5,350. There’s one that’s even selling for more than $64,000!
But what’s interesting about these kits if you read the product description is that they can be built by two people in just eight hours. Each “cabin kit” also comes with all the building materials and directions you would need. There’s even a kit that can make a two-room tiny house! Plus, all of the options are less than 250 square feet too, in case your space is limited.
While these tiny cabins could act as little backyard getaway, they don’t come with electricity or utilities, which is an added expense. And if you’re wondering exactly what you could do in this tiny home exactly, well the product description mentions that they are ideal as a “backyard recreation lounge, guest house or even a home office.”
Oddly enough, these tiny homes are one of Amazon’s most sought-out products right now. So if you have the space, the time and the money, it might be worth investing in, to finally live out those tiny house dreams of yours.
Below, we’ve rounded up the top six more ~affordable~ options to browse before they might sell out.

3004964471,"Apple, Google release technology for pandemic apps","Many governments have already tried, mostly unsuccessfully, to roll out their own phone apps to fight the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. Many of those apps have encountered technical problems on Apple and Android phones and haven't been widely adopted. They often use GPS to track people’s location, which Apple and Google are banning from their new tool because of privacy and accuracy concerns.

Public health agencies from Germany to the states of Alabama and South Carolina have been waiting to use the Apple-Google model, while other governments have said the tech giants' privacy restrictions will be a hindrance because public health workers will have no access to the data.

The companies said they're not trying to replace contact tracing, a pillar of infection control that involves trained public health workers reaching out to people who may have been exposed to an infected person. But they said their automatic “exposure notification” system can augment that process and slow the spread of COVID-19 by virus carriers who are interacting with strangers and aren't yet showing symptoms.

The identity of app users will be protected by encryption and anonymous identifier beacons that change frequently.

“User adoption is key to success and we believe that these strong privacy protections are also the best way to encourage use of these apps,” the companies said in a joint statement Wednesday.

The companies said the new technology — the product of a rare partnership between the rival tech giants — solves some of the main technical challenges that governments have had in building Bluetooth-based apps. It will make it easier for iPhones and Android phones to detect each other, work across national and regional borders and fix some of the problems that led previous apps to quickly drain a phone’s battery.

The statement Wednesday also included remarks from state officials in North Dakota, Alabama and South Carolina signaling that they plan to use it.

""We invite other states to join us in leveraging smartphone technologies to strengthen existing contact tracing efforts, which are critical to getting communities and economies back up and running,” said North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, a Republican.

North Dakota had already launched a location-tracking app that about 4% of state residents are using, higher than other U.S. states with similar apps but falling far short of the participation rate that experts say is needed to make such technology useful.

Tim Brookins, the CEO of ProudCrowd, a startup that developed North Dakota's app, said Wednesday that North Dakotans will now be asked to download two complementary apps — his model, to help public health workers track where COVID-19 patients have been, and the Apple-Google model, to privately notify people who might have been exposed to the virus.",en,neutral,0.585249,neutral,0.6134539999999999,"['Google', 'Apple']","['North Dakota', 'smartphone', 'CEO', 'Alabama', 'infection control', 'encryption', 'GPS', 'Android', 'Public health', 'public health', 'Republican', 'battery', 'privacy', 'virus', 'Google', 'pandemic', 'Germany', 'COVID-19', 'South Carolina', 'Apple', 'Bluetooth', 'iPhones', 'U.S', 'Doug Burgum', 'Tim Brookins', 'ProudCrowd']","['technology', 'release', 'pandemic', 'Google', 'Apple', 'apps', 'phone apps', 'North Dakota', 'public health', 'Public health', 'North', 'Dakota', 'privacy', 'phone', 'health', 'Public', 'companies', 'COVID-19', 'people', 'governments', 'model', 'users', 'smartphone', 'CEO', 'Alabama', 'infection control', 'encryption', 'GPS', 'Android', 'Republican', 'battery', 'virus', 'Germany', 'South Carolina']","['#PublicHealth', '#NorthDakota', '#AppleInc', '#Privacy', '#Google', '#Pandemic', '#Android', '#Alabama', '#SouthCarolina', '#Virus', '#GPS', '#GlobalPositioningSystem', '#Germany', '#InfectionControl', '#Encryption', '#Battery', '#Smartphone', '#RepublicanParty', '#CEO', '#ChiefExecutiveOfficer']",10,14,467,2835,2020-05-20 19:26:43+00:00,Odessa American (TX),"{'avatar_url': None, 'id': 1281705, 'name': 'Matt O'}","{'sentences': ['Public health agencies from Germany to the states of Alabama '

3004993960,Huawei Suddenly Gives Millions Of Users This Surprise Google Alternative,"Sergei Karpukhin/TASS
 
  
 
Huawei is now in a race against time. Until last Friday, its mission was to keep government and enterprise users—as well 650 million active smartphone users—loyal to the brand while it fought the U.S. blacklist. Until last Friday, despite shrinking sales overseas—primarily due to the loss of Google, the company continued to post decent financials based on its performance at home.
 
And then last week hit. The U.S. celebrated the blacklist’s first anniversary by exponentially increasing the stakes, changing everything for Huawei. All flagship phones will be hit by Taiwan’s TSMC cutting off supplies—those sold at home and overseas. The key beneficiaries—somewhat ironically—may well be other Chinese smartphone vendors able to replicate Huawei’s successful recipe. 
 
Despite all this, Huawei has suddenly unveiled a surprise alternative to Google’s search and Play Store, a defiant move against both the blacklist and Google, another targeted attempt to offer a viable full-fat Android and Play Store alternative. 
 
 
MORE FROM FORBESFurious China Has Just 12-Months To Save Huawei After 'Crushing' Trump AttackBy Zak Doffman 
Huawei and its supporters in Beijing have around 12-months to find a compromise with Washington or a workable replacement for that silicon supply chain—after that, stockpiles will diminish. Huawei is taking the view that a compromise or workaround can and must be found. The alternative is too drastic to contemplate. This time, the use of the word “survival” is not melodramatic. 
 
 
And so to the company’s hastily rejigged HAS2020—its global analyst conference. There’s little surprise that, as management recoils from the shockwave of the latest U.S. beating, there has also been business as usual talk of new tech and impressive innovation stemming from the 15% of sales it commits to RD. And, of course, the continuing search for those elusive Google gap-fillers.
 
Piece by piece, we have seen Huawei build an ecosystem that it sees as a third-way alternative to Google’s full-fat Android and iOS. Last year, hopes were pinned on the most radical possible option, an entirely new, ground-up OS—but that was soon watered down into an expansion of the open-source version of Android that Huawei will not lose. What we did see, though, was a huge acceleration of Huawei Mobile Services (HMS), a swap-out for Google’s GMS, and the app ecosystem to go with it.
 
In recent weeks, we have seen a trail of confirmations around replacements for Google apps—like maps, and a revamped AppGallery to replace the Play Store. We have even seen Huawei talk up app security measures as a differentiator to Google, which has had issues with screening the millions of apps now on Play Store.
 
Back in March, just ahead of the P40 launch, I reported on pilot testing of two new Huawei apps, “Search” and “AppSearch,” both intended as replacements for Google functionality on Huawei phones. The first to replace core search itself—a major money-spinner for Google, the second to make it easy for users to search for and install popular apps, either from Huawei’s AppGallery or third-party stores.
 
Both these apps had their issues. The use of a Chinese search engine, subject to Beijing’s influence if not laws outside China, is clearly an issue. We have seen reports of how other such platforms might be subject to interference. We have also seen reports about China’s efforts to control the messages received overseas, and with its close ties to Huawei many will fear the worst.
 
 
  
  
  Huawei AppGallery
 
  
 
On the AppSearch front, the issues were more clearcut. It could be viewed as a clever way to bypass U.S. restrictions in spirit if not the letter of the law. Many of the most popular apps are U.S. owned, and where they are not available on the AppGallery, there will be concerns raised about Huawei easing installation for users through the use of an official app on the AppGallery.
 
Back in March, AppSearch was reportedly being tested in Germany. The app’s landing page at the time said it was designed to help users install their favorite apps on Huawei smartphones, listing Facebook and WhatsApp as examples. Shortly after my report was published, Huawei revoked access to AppSearch and its publicity. An instructional YouTube video, posted by Huawei Germany, was also pulled.
 
Well now it’s back—the race against time is on. The renamed “Petal Search” combines both “Search” and “AppSearch” into a single install. “Petal Search puts the world in the palm of your hand,” Huawei says, confirming that users can “search for your favorite phone apps with our state of the art technology.”
 
On the search front, Petal Search offers Huawei curated “daily weather forecasts and top news, live sports scores and schedules, video, image, and music searches,” as well as “financial news and stock market updates.” 
 
All that plus the ability to search for and install apps. The biggest issue post-blacklist has been that app installation and Google workarounds have intimidated regular users. The new Petal Search is intended to make everything official and assured. Search for an app like “Instagram” or “Facebook,” and the results will come complete with an install option. If the app is available on the AppGallery, then that’s where it comes from. If not, a third-party app store will be used instead. 
 
No word yet on the security measures to screen those applications coming from outside the AppGallery, and there are likely to be regional and national variances on what is available. What is clear, though, is that any suggestion that this might be an issue for Huawei in light of U.S. restrictions has diminished with escalating tensions. Huawei wants to ensure that as many as possible of its 650 million active smartphone users stick with the brand over the coming difficult months.
 
Meanwhile, Huawei’s primary domestic rival in overseas markets, Xiaomi, will be watching on from the sidelines. It has gladly picked up the baton to build from where Huawei left off. In its first quarter results, released today, the company reports better than 13% sales growth, building on its stellar end to last year. 
 
MORE FROM FORBESHuawei Loses Millions Of Users As Serious New Threat From China Gets RealBy Zak Doffman 
With international consumers having shown a willingness to buy Chinese phones and a lack of willingness to drop Google, Xiaomi is enviously placed. According to Xiaomi, overseas revenue for the quarter increased almost 49% year-on-year, “and for the first time, accounted for half of our total revenue.” These are Huawei-like results, and will be a genuine concern for its larger rival.
 
Unexpectedly, Huawei has now offered its users a viable quick-fix for the today problem—albeit nothing yet as to how the silicon issue might resolve. As the company deals with that challenge, its domestic rival has shown that those millions of international users might not wait around to see what happens.",en,neutral,0.52474,neutral,0.738992,"['Google', 'Huawei']","['smartphone', 'smartphones', 'TASS', 'Xiaomi', 'Mobile', 'Huawei', 'Washington', 'Facebook', 'Instagram', 'Taiwan', 'WhatsApp', 'Android', 'stock market', 'iOS', 'financial news', 'search engine', 'app store', 'palm', 'YouTube', 'TSMC', 'Chinese', 'China', 'silicon', 'Beijing', 'Google', 'clearcut', 'Germany', 'Play Store', 'ecosystem', 'flagship', 'U.S', 'RD', 'AppGallery', 'Huawei Germany', 'Sergei Karpukhin', 'Zak Doffman', 'Piece', 'FORBESFurious China', 'Huawei Mobile Services', 'HMS', 'GMS', 'P40', 'Huawei’s AppGallery', 'Huawei AppGallery', 'AppSearch', 'Petal Search', 'FORBESHuawei Loses Millions Of Users']","['Users', 'Surprise', 'Millions', 'Google', 'Huawei', 'Alternative', 'Huawei apps', 'Google apps', 'Google’s search', 'users', 'issues', 'U.S.', 'apps', 'time', 'company', 'search', 'China', 'AppGallery', 'AppSearch', 'smartphone', 'smartphones', 'TASS', 'Xiaomi', 'trail', 'Mobile', 'open-source', 'Washington', 'Facebook', 'Instagram', 'Taiwan', 'WhatsApp', 'Android', 'stock market', 'iOS', 'financial news', 'search engine', 'app store', 'palm', 'acceleration', 'YouTube', 'TSMC', 'Chinese', 'silicon', 'Beijing', 'clearcut', 'baton', 'Germany', 'Play Store', 'ecosystem', 'flagship']","['#Huawei', '#Google', '#China', '#Smartphone', '#GooglePlay', '#Android', '#Xiaomi', '#Beijing', '#Silicon', '#Ecosystem', '#Germany', '#Facebook', '#TASS', '#TASS', '#Flagship', '#Taiwan', '#TSMC', '#TSMC', '#Washington', '#IOS', '#OpensourceModel', '#Acceleration', '#MobileAlabama', '#Trail', '#WebSearchEngine', '#Clearcutting', '#WhatsApp', '#YouTube', '#Arecaceae', '#FinancialNews', '#StockMarket', '#Instagram', '#AppStore', '#Baton']",50,54,1178,6992,2020-05-20 22:16:20+00:00,Google News,"{'avatar_url': None, 'id': 1174816, 'name': 'Zak Doffman'}","{'sentences': ['We have even seen Huawei talk up app security measures as a '

3005047341,Basecamp CMO: ‘We’re Anti-Facebook And Google’,"Project management software maker Basecamp does not mess with Facebook and Google.

“We vote with our dollars for the world we want to see, and we don't want to see a world ruled by a handful of companies,” said head of marketing Andy Didorosi.

Basecamp avoids online consumer tracking, which is “creepy,” Didorosi said. Facebook and Google are also too expensive and ineffective at driving conversions for a B2B software company like Basecamp.

But even if they were the best converting marketplaces, Basecamp still wouldn’t spend money there.

“It’s like taking steroids,” Didorosi said. “It feels good at first, but then you take it for too long and you die.”

Instead, Basecamp leans into event marketing, blogs, email newsletters, podcasts and word of mouth to reach its audience, limiting tracking and diversifying spend as much as possible.

“There’s lots of interactive stuff we can do vs. spending $5,000 a day on one black hole,” Didorosi said.

Didorosi joined Basecamp, which has 59 employees, in late 2019 as its first head of marketing. The business, launched in 1999, was early to the remote work space but now faces new competitors as virtual business becomes the norm under COVID-19 lockdowns. Basecamp declined to share annual revenue figures.

Didorosi spoke with AdExchanger.

        
        

        
        
		
AdExchanger: Why is Basecamp anti-Facebook and Google? 

ANDY DIDOROSI: We don't want to feed these oligarchies anymore. We’re hoping to spread our dollars as our vote against consolidation of power on the internet. Our cofounder invented Ruby on Rails, an open-source language a lot of the internet is based on. It’s designed to be an open, inclusive internet that has a large, thriving number of people.

My predecessor spent an enormous amount of money on Facebook, and we didn’t get the response we expected. So it’s not like we had a great thing going.

Why wasn’t Facebook effective for Basecamp?

Selling B2B business software via social feeds isn’t effective. The CPMs on Facebook, Google and Instagram are too high. The cost per result is too low. We do have a Google [search] ad, because you need to pay them protection money to guard your brand name. We’d prefer not to, but they’ve developed a fiefdom around people searching.

It’s more work for me to deal with all the networks rather than typing a big number into one of them. But that’s the power of diversification.

Not many companies make business decisions based on their morals. Why Basecamp?

Basecamp has always led in things that don't pass the smell test. We never want to show someone an ad because of who they are. We only want to show someone an ad because of what they’re searching in that moment.

The main issue we’re coming up against now is tracking pixels in emails that report everything to the sender. It’s an invasion of privacy.

So where do you market?

We go pretty analog. We do conferences. Creative Mornings, an event where people meet once a week to talk about creative endeavors, was a partner of ours before the pandemic. We’ve worked with them to modify our sponsorship to be digital.

Basecamp has advertised on podcasts in the past, but now we’re doing a consolidated strategy. We’ll target niche shows to get a message to specific audiences. If you have a targeted output, you can speak to their challenges.

We have a blog that’s really well-read, so we engage people through that. We’re bringing back our newsletter. But a lot of it is our product and simply getting the word out.

How do you measure the success of your marketing?

We don't have any KPIs. We look at the general trend of the business. Are we trending upwards? Are we adding more people than we’re losing? Great.

Most software businesses look for growth at any cost. They’re lighting cash on fire to outgrow the next guy. We just don’t subscribe to that. We have a calm, happy company with over 100,000 businesses working on [our software] daily. That’s a great place to be. It’s not a resting point on the way to somewhere else.

How do you determine how much to spend on marketing?

It’s a hunch. If we put a dollar toward an objective and see that we got a result back, you look at that and go, “Hey, does this seem right? Do we like the way this ad sounds? Did enough people take up our offer and become long-term customers?”

There’s no golden ratio. We compare apples to apples. Is it an apple for a dollar? Fine. Is it an apple for $9? No. You don’t need a spreadsheet for that insight.

That’s not to say we might not sophisticate our approach. But it takes a lot of time for not an enormous impact.

Are current privacy laws such as GDPR and CCPA strong or effective enough?

I think they’re great. They are a shock to people. Software is set up for default tracking. [With] GDPR, unless you have a legitimate use case, you shouldn’t be tracking in the first place, let alone sending it to [other] people.

The internet has been warped into a behavior modification tool. Only regulation will stop that. Facebook has created the best propaganda machine in history. Twitter banning political ads is a start, but we have to litigate against this stuff.

3004918256,Amazon faces multiple COVID-19 complaints to safety watchdog about working conditions,"Amazon workers have made multiple complaints to the Occupation Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) citing concerns over COVID-19.

OSHA had received 35 complaints related to Amazon Fulfillment Center, Amazon-Whole Food Shoppers, Amazon Robotics, and Amazon Logistics sites as of May 18.

A spokesperson told Newsweek the agency, part of the Department of Labor, was taking ""swift and decisive action to protect America's workers"" amid the coronavirus pandemic.

It has received complaints across various industries as workers fulfill their duties while attempting to adapt to the threat of coronavirus.

In response to the complaints, Amazon spokesperson Lisa Levandowski told Newsweek the company was ""committed to ensuring a clean and safe workplace"" and that ""safety is our top priority.""

""We've implemented over 150 significant process changes—from enhanced cleaning and social distancing measures to new efforts like disinfectant spraying,"" Levandowski said.

""We've also distributed personal protective gear like masks across our entire operations network. We'll continue to invest in safety, pay, and benefits for our teams who are playing an invaluable role in getting items to communities around the world.""

Details of the complaints come after Democratic Reps. Rashida Tlaib and Debbie Dingell, both representing Michigan, called for a nationwide investigation into Amazon sites, citing concerns raised with them by constituents.

Writing on Twitter, Tlaib shared a message to Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos: ""Just in case you were unaware, you just p***** off two Congresswomen from Mich & we don't play. Your corp needs to focus on worker safety. They deserve better than this.""

Amazon subsequently invited the pair to visit any of its facilities to see conditions, stating they are calling for safety measures ""that are already in place.""

Responding to the OSHA complaints, Dingell told Newsweek: ""Workers matter, their voices matter, and we must listen to their reports. OSHA must take these reports seriously, and take serious action to ensure everyone has access to a safe and healthy workplace.""

Tlaib also reiterated calls for a probe into Amazon sites, while suggesting there may be more workers wishing to make complaints but who had not filed them.

""Workers deserve to be heard and they deserve a thorough investigation. No one should be forced to work it in unsafe conditions,"" she told Newsweek.

OSHA confirmed it had received a letter from Tlaib and Dingell calling for an investigation.

A spokesperson said OSHA ""is investigating all complaints and responding appropriately"" while ""working diligently"" to ensure employers are meeting safety obligations.

Amazon workers have held protests during the coronavirus pandemic, with demonstrations at sites in Michigan and New York. Some chose to call in sick on May 1 to demand improved conditions.

The Brit took to twitter to say that the version available was “not the film I intended or made” and that he was asking Amazon to investigate. He later posted a follow-up tweet suggesting that it was the intimate sex scenes in the film – which depicts a relationship between a young farmer played by Josh O’Connor and a migrant worker played by Alec Secăreanu – that had been altered against his wishes.

“I’m interested if any of you have evidence of @PrimeVideo (Amazon Prime USA) censoring naked women or intimate/sex scenes within heterosexual stories on their streaming service? Or if they just censor queer stories?” Lee wrote.

3004975514,AOC-led push to kill Amazon's NYC move under renewed scrutiny as city faces catastrophic job losses,"Amazon warehouse workers walks off the job demanding greater safeguards against the coronavirus; reaction and analysis from Attorney Andrew Stoltmann on ‘America’s News HQ.’




As New York City suffers an economic crisis on top of the coronavirus pandemic, some are looking back with regrets at the left-wing campaign that forced Amazon to scupper a plan to bring tens of thousands of jobs to the area – arguing this project could have helped the Big Apple weather the storm.
“At this time when coronavirus is ravaging incomes across New York, wouldn’t it be nice if the city and state at least knew that one of the world’s largest companies, one of the rare concerns positioned to thrive through the crisis, had made a long-term commitment to locate between 25,000 and 40,000 high-paying jobs here?” an editorial in the New York Daily News said.
NYC HEALTH COMMISSIONER APOLOGIZES TO NYPD AFTER REJECTING CORONAVIRUS MASK PLEA
The criticism from the local paper this month comes amid estimates from the city’s Independent Budget Office that New York City could lose 475,000 jobs by next March and see a $9.7 billion decrease in tax revenue over the next two years, according to The Wall Street Journal.
Amazon had planned to build a second NYC headquarters in Long Island City in Queens, but community activists and left-wing lawmakers like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-NY., and state senators rallied to block the move in 2019. In particular, they had zeroed in on the estimated $2.5 billion in incentives that Amazon would receive in order to tempt them to the area.
""Now what I DON’T want is for our public funds to be funding freebie helipads for Amazon + robber baron billionaires,"" Ocasio-Cortez tweeted at the time, ""all while NYCHA and public schools go underfunded  mom+pops get nowhere near that kind of a break.""
AMAZON PULLS OUT OF PLAN TO BUILD NEW YORK CITY HEADQUARTERS AFTER BACKLASH
It was a battle that AOC, and other anti-Amazon local politicians, won when in February 2019, Amazon announced it was taking its jobs elsewhere.
""For Amazon, the commitment to build a new headquarters requires positive, collaborative relationships with state and local elected officials who will be supportive over the long-term,” the company said in a statement. “While polls show that 70 percent of New Yorkers support our plans and investment, a number of state and local politicians have made it clear that they oppose our presence and will not work with us to build the type of relationships that are required to go forward with the project we and many others envisioned in Long Island City.”
It infuriated even fellow Democrats like Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who blasted “a small group politicians [who] put their own narrow political interests above their community.”
Now, with Amazon still going strong as they have become an essential service for Americans trying to get their goods while avoiding brick-and-mortar stores, some are questioning that lobbying effort once again.
""The impact of AOC's reckless scuttling of the Amazon deal cannot be overstated. Not only did AOC cost New York 25,000 good-paying jobs, she sent a message to job creators everywhere that they were no longer welcome in her city,” Alfredo Ortiz, CEO of Job Creators Network, told Fox News.
OCASIO-CORTEZ CHEERS AS AMAZON REPORTEDLY RECONSIDERS NY HQ AFTER FIERCE OPPOSITION
“With New York City expected to lose 500,000 jobs due to the pandemic, AOC's brand of left-wing politics has no place in New York or anywhere else,” he said. “Only by unleashing the spirit of free enterprise can our economy recover, something AOC would never understand.""
Meanwhile, AOC is also taking heat from a Democratic primary challenger, who is citing the Amazon case as an example that Ocasio-Cortez is out of touch and doesn’t care about the people she was sent to represent.
“If she really cared, she wouldn’t drive away 25,000 jobs like she did,” Michelle Caruso-Cabrera told Yahoo News recently.
The Daily News, meanwhile, which is traditionally more representative of left-wing views in its editorials, didn’t mention Ocasio-Cortez by name – but clearly had her in its sights when it ripped into “smug” elected officials in its editorial this month.
“Wouldn’t it be nice if elected officials hadn’t been so smug and shortsighted as to insist that our great metropolis had so much going for it that it could easily look the best economic development opportunity in the modern history of the city in the mouth?” its editorial asked.

It went on to note that critics of Amazon were right to raise concerns about the company, including complaints about safety, data handling and the threat to traditional stores.
“But we do know that our great city’s tax revenue outlook would look a lot rosier right now if a handful of posturing pols hadn’t run one of the world’s top companies out of town on a rail,” it said.

3004782163,thyssenkrupp Elevator Selects CoreView’s SaaS Management Platform to Maximize the Value of its Microsoft 365 Environment,"BOSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
CoreView, the only intelligent SaaS Management Platform (SMP), today announced that thyssenkrupp Elevator has selected its flagship solution to help optimize the organization’s management of its Microsoft 365 (M365) environment. thyssenkrupp Elevator is one of the leading passenger transportation companies in the world with more than 50,000 employees operating within a decentralized IT environment. Using CoreView’s SMP, the company is able to gain actionable insights into their cloud and SaaS infrastructure so they can easily manage, secure, and promote adoption of key productivity apps. thyssenkrupp Elevator’s IT environment will be harmonized in order to fulfill ever-changing market and customer needs.



Integration is a major challenge for many companies because IT teams often don’t know what tools and platforms are being used by each organization and how interoperable they are with one another. Rather than relying on a variety of products, each with its own administrative console, CoreView pulls insights into a single- pane-of-glass view to allow IT leaders to manage application policies, delegate and automate responsibilities, take corrective action, track application usage, and optimize their M365 licenses to fit their employees’ needs. This last point is particularly important as recent CoreView research found that 56% of a businesses’ Microsoft 365 licenses are inactive, underutilized, oversized, or unassigned. These are the types of seemingly small cloud costs that undercut the value a business is trying to gain by acquiring another company.



“We needed a scalable solution that could provide us with an enhanced view of our SaaS and cloud environment as they navigated the challenges associated with our large-scale integration,” said Rob Lewis, Global Program Manager at thyssenkrupp Elevator. “As early adopters of M365, we have some built-in advantages to our migration; however, CoreView will enable us to confidently mitigate risk, identify cost-savings, and drive adoption during our migration.”



CoreView’s flagship SMP is a critical tool for enterprises tasked with managing the costs and security risks of their cloud environment. The platform’s user-friendly features deliver actionable insights within a single unified view that help them manage, secure, and train their staff on key M365 productivity apps. On average, CoreView customers save 30% on license spending and boost adoption by 40%.



“Businesses undergoing a major integration must not only merge two environments, but also implement strict governance, identify security issues, and meet compliance requirements,” said CoreView CEO Michael Morrison. “Pandemic or not, many major projects must move forward so it’s important that IT teams are not only able to execute quickly but also in full confidence that they aren’t introducing new risks or costs to the organization.”

3004963252,5 Reasons You Should Play Amazon’s Surprisingly Fun Game ‘Crucible’,"Crucible is a surprisingly fun competitive shooter and the first major video game released by ... [+] Amazon. Here's why you should take it for a spin.
 
   
  Credit: Relentless Studios / Amazon 
  
 
When Amazon announced Crucible a couple weeks back, reactions from gamers and the gaming press were somewhere between tepid and unenthusiastic.
 
Crucible’s announcement trailer just fell flat, and didn’t really show off what makes the game honestly quite a bit of fun to play.
 
I was able to take part in a demo of the game last week, and I found myself enjoying it quite a bit. I’ll have to play it some more to really decide if it’s something I’ll stick with long-term, and much depends on Amazon’s support of the game going forward.
 
Designed by Amazon-owned Relentless Studios, the game—available on Steam only for the time being—has a lot going for it out the gates (it’s just gone live as we speak). Here are five reasons you should play Crucible.
 
 
1. It’s free-to-play.
 
 
  
  
   
   Crucible
 
   
  Credit: Relentless Studios / Amazon 
  
 
This is the first and perhaps most important reason you should try out Crucible. There is literally no financial investment to give it a shot.
 
Crucible will offer a seasonal Battle Pass similar to Fortnite, Apex Legends and various other free-to-play games out there, as well as items from the game’s Item Shop that include Hunter and weapon skins and all the other cosmetics you’ve come to expect over the years.
 
 
Since the game is a third-person shooter, whatever skins you equip will be easily viewable which is nice.
 
Still, I wouldn’t recommend even a free-to-play game if it didn’t have other qualities that make it worth your precious time.
 
2. Crucible is a MOBA that’s actually accessible and fun.

Okay, so here’s how the game works.
 
Matches place on a very large map. It’s a colorful alien world filled with various AI monsters, healing items and so forth. You drop in at various points on the map and can choose where to respawn each time you die (except for in Alpha Hunters mode which has respawning disabled).
 
Hopefully Amazon will release new maps in future seasons, but for now there’s just one and it does the trick. It looks good and it’s very large with a fair amount of variety in terrain. 
 
Scattered across the map are Harvesters which you can capture for your team to passively gain Essence, which levels your characters up granting them new powers. You can also gain Essence from killing monsters and enemies. As you level up, your character will gain new powers or power-up starting abilities. Leveling up is crucial since the team with the highest level will also have the most powerful abilities, giving them an edge in combat. Matches begin with teams rushing off to level up and stock up on healing items as much as possible before engaging in combat with other players.
 
It’s all very focused on tactical teamwork and requires coordination and communication in order to win. You don’t want to rush off into battle alone against three enemy players since you’ll just die and have to respawn far away. But you might want to run off and tackle one of the many side objectives that pop up over the map before the enemy team does, since these can give your squad a serious advantage.
 
In other words, it’s basically a MOBA like League of Legends, with neutral AI enemies and two teams of characters that gain new powers as matches go on. The big difference is that it’s far, far more accessible and easy to grasp. I’ve always found MOBAs to be incredibly frustrating, but I had a blast with Crucible.
 
That’s also partly because it’s an action shooter at the same time. You have abilities and powers, but that’s all under the framework of a competitive third-person shooter. Skills that apply to competitive shooters apply, which I think will give more players like me a chance.
 
There are a total of 10 different Hunters—of human, alien and robot variety—to choose from, each with wildly different abilities and play-styles. I’ve only tested out a couple so far, but I’ve fought against all of them. There’s tons of variety from one to the next, and forming a good team with a balanced suite of abilities will be a crucial part of the strategy.
 
3. Heart of Hives is a blast.

Crucible has three game modes and I’ve played all three.
 
Harvester Command pits two teams of eight against one another. You have to capture Harvesters to score points similar to a match of Domination in Call Of Duty. It’s the most basic mode and a good way to test out different Hunters and their abilities.
 
Alpha Hunters is Crucible’s Battle Royale mode. Eight teams of two head off into the map with respawning disabled and you play until only one team is left standing. More on this mode in a bit.
 
By far Crucible’s best and most engaging mode is Heart of Hives. This is the most exciting mode and requires the most teamwork. Here’s how it works:
 
Two teams of four face off against one another. Like the other two modes, you’ll start out at a point of your choosing on the map and break up to go gather Essence and level up, gather health packs and so forth. You’ll want to capture some Harvesters for the passive Essence boost they give you, and possibly recapture some the enemy team has taken.
 
The big twist from Harvester Command is that giant AI bosses called Hives spawn across the map. These aren’t super hard to kill, but both teams end up converging on a Hive at once and these often end up being big, tense fights.
 
When the Hive goes down, the Heart is exposed and you have to capture it by interacting with it for a few seconds. It’s long enough that an enemy can easily come and knock you off the Heart, so you’ll want to make sure to really clear an area before attempting to capture one.
 
The first team to capture three Hearts wins. It’s genuinely fun and intense, and I’m excited to see where they go with this mode in the future. It reminds me a little bit of Destiny’s Gambit mode, though more PvP focused.
 
4. Alpha Hunters has a cool twist on the Battle Royale genre.

My second favorite mode in Crucible is Alpha Hunters. This is basically Duos Battle Royale, though only sixteen players fight at any given time.
 
Like other Battle Royale games, a circle slowly closes on the map, forcing teams closer to one another.
 
The interesting twist, and something I’d like to see more of in other games, is that players can join forces if they’re down a teammate.
 
If you find another solo player you can ping them and offer up an alliance, similar to Hunger Games. Now you have a team again, giving you a better chance at defeating the remaining Duos.
 
The only problem with this is that it doesn’t last. There can be only one winning team, and newly formed alliances don’t count. If you’re the last two players standing at the end of the match, you’ll need to kill or be killed.
 
5. Impressions are positive all around.

I’m not the only one who played in the demo of this game and enjoyed what I played. From what I can tell, most impressions so far are positive.
 
The Washington Post’s Gene Park writes:
 
“It’s hard to say what kind of legs “Crucible,” will have. Competition for attention, even in the shooting genre, is fierce. But it’s easy to say what “Crucible,” gets right: Gorgeous graphics, controls well, a low barrier for entry, low barriers of entries for players of many skill levels and a solid mix of today’s most popular genre ideas.
 
What matters, though, is that by the end of my two-hour session, I found myself wanting to learn more about the game, and explore upgrade paths of several other characters. In an industry filled with also-ran games, my skepticism for “Crucible” has waned.”
 
Over at Polygon, Austen Goslin writes:
 
“Crucible is the best kind of familiar, as this description likely makes you think of games as diverse as League of Legends or Overwatch, but Crucible’s development team has put enough thought into how to remix these ideas that the result is worth at least trying, even if you’re up to your eyeballs in new, competitive online games.”
 
Engadget’s Nick Summers says that Amazon is finally serious about video games, even if he isn’t sure this one will capture the hearts and minds of gamers:
 
“Crucible is a risky but confident play for the MOBA and battle royale crowd. A brand-new IP with no established movie, TV show or comic book fanbase to lean on. Regardless of how it lands, the title will be a tipping point; the moment when yet another technology giant started competing for video game fans’ time and money.”
 
Nick Statt, writing at The Verge, thinks it will find an audience:
 
“Crucible is highly derivative and designed with a rather bland aesthetic, but it ends up being surprisingly unique when you’re actually playing it. That makes all of its well-worn game modes, including a mini battle royale and one inspired by e-sports heavyweights like League of Legends, feel more like new experiences rather than remixes of popular classics.
 
“After trying an early version of the game for a few hours ahead of release last week, I’m fairly confident Crucible, which releases for PC only on May 20th, will find an audience that’s been itching for this particular mashup of design ideas and genres in an accessible package. It’s fun and dynamic and has a depth of strategy to it that, while not perhaps at the level of a Dota 2 or League of Legends, is certainly deeper than your standard shooter or battle royale. How big that audience is, especially when it’s competing with so many similar games doing similar things, will be a test for Amazon’s prowess as a game publisher and its ability to market the game using its Twitch platform.”
 
Crucible is out today on Steam. If it sounds fun, you should give it a shot. It will cost you nothing but time. I had a lot of fun previewing the game, but I’ll need to spend a lot more time with it to really solidify an opinion or pen a review. We’ll see where Season 1 goes and whether this hodge-podge of game genres and modes can find its wings.
 
Note: Crucible is set to launch at 12 pm PT today but is still showing not available on Steam as of this writing.",en,positive,0.9846030000000001,positive,0.9788469999999999,"['Amazon', 'Crucible', 'Surprisingly Fun Game']","['MOBA', 'MOBAs', 'Fortnite', 'skepticism', 'PC', 'video game', 'Overwatch', 'e-sports', 'comic book', 'derivative', 'mashup', 'Amazon', 'Polygon', 'remix', 'Essence', 'third-person shooter', 'spin', 'The Washington Post', 'power-up', 'spawn', 'AI', 'cosmetics', 'Twitch', 'PvP', 'Crucible', 'tense', 'Relentless', 'The Verge', 'Battle Royale', 'pop', 'Dota 2', 'circle', 'itching', 'Call Of Duty', 'free-to-play', 'robot', 'Engadget', 'Destiny', 'competitive shooter', 'Steam', 'Gambit', 'Gene Park', 'Legends', 'Relentless Studios', 'Apex Legends', 'Hunter', 'Matches', 'Hopefully Amazon', 'Alpha Hunters', 'Hive', 'Duos Battle Royale', 'Hunger Games', 'Austen Goslin', 'Nick Summers', 'fans', 'Nick Statt', 'Verge', 'Credit: Relentless Studios / Amazon', 'Item Shop', 'MOBA like League', 'Harvester Command', 'Domination in Call Of Duty', 'Duos', 'League', 'Dota']","['Crucible', 'Amazon', 'Game', 'Reasons', 'game modes', 'Crucible’s Battle', 'game', 'enemy team', 'team', 'mode', 'players', 'Battle', 'abilities', 'time', 'enemies', 'genre', 'Royale', 'MOBA', 'MOBAs', 'Fortnite', 'battle royale', 'skepticism', 'PC', 'video game', 'Overwatch', 'e-sports', 'comic book', 'derivative', 'mashup', 'Polygon', 'remix', 'Essence', 'tipping point', 'third-person shooter', 'spin', 'The Washington Post', 'power-up', 'spawn', 'AI', 'cosmetics', 'Twitch', 'PvP', 'tense', 'Relentless', 'The Verge', 'respawn', 'respawning', 'Battle Royale', 'pop', 'Dota 2', 'circle', 'itching', 'Call Of Duty', 'free-to-play', 'robot', 'Engadget', 'Destiny', 'competitive shooter', 'Steam', 'Gambit']","['#CrucibleTheatre', '#Amazon', '#RelentlessRecords', '#MultiplayerOnlineBattleArena', '#Spawning', '#Essence', '#BattleRoyale', '#Steam', '#Freetoplay', '#MOBA', '#AI', '#ArtificialIntelligence', '#BattleRoyal', '#VideoGame', '#ThirdpersonShooter', '#ShootingSports', '#Spin', '#Fortnite', '#Cosmetics', '#Powerup', '#PopMusic', '#Robot', '#CallOfDuty', '#Spawn', '#GrammaticalTense', '#Destiny', '#Gambit', '#PlayerVersusPlayer', '#Circle', '#TheWashingtonPost', '#Skepticism', '#Polygon', '#Overwatch', '#Remix', '#Engadget', '#ComicBook', '#TippingPoint', '#TheVerge', '#Derivative', '#ESports', '#PC', '#PersonalComputer', '#Itch', '#Mashup', '#Dota2', '#Twitchtv']",151,96,1898,10492,2020-05-20 19:19:21+00:00,Forbes,"{'avatar_url': None, 'id': 2542155, 'name': 'Erik Kain'}","{'sentences': ['Crucible will offer a seasonal Battle Pass similar to '

3004982900,Apple and Google release coronavirus contact tracing technology for public health mobile apps,"Apple and Google are releasing contact tracing technology to help public health officials develop mobile apps that can identify and test people who’ve spent time with or near someone infected with the coronavirus, the companies announced Wednesday.

A number of U.S. states, including North Dakota and Alabama, and 22 countries have received access to the technology that was designed to help governments better track and contain the spread of the virus, the companies said.

In a statement, North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum described the smartphone technology as being “critical to getting communities and economies back up and running.”

Been exposed to the coronavirus?:Apple and Google will warn you. Here's how.

Apple, Google team up on contact tracing:Public health apps using the tech could warn you of coronavirus exposure

Mobile apps using the technology can track users who are in the vicinity of an infected person for at least five minutes and anonymously notify them. The apps will rely on Bluetooth technology, which is commonly used to link wireless speakers and keyboards.

By joining forces, Apple and Google have made it possible to use most smartphones to share information about possible exposure to the virus. But some research suggests that widespread adoption – by some estimates, 60% – is needed for mobile apps to be effective in helping to contain an outbreak.

Nearly 3 in 5 Americans said they would be unwilling or unable to use Google and Apple's contact tracing technology, according to a Washington Post-University of Maryland poll.

Some public health officials have been frustrated by rules set by Apple and Google that prevent them from harvesting the location, phone number and other personal details from users, though mobile apps can ask users to divulge that information.

“User adoption is key to success and we believe that these strong privacy protections are also the best way to encourage use of these apps,” Apple and Google said in a statement. “Each user gets to decide whether or not to opt-in to exposure notifications; the system does not collect or use location from the device; and if a person is diagnosed with Covid-19, it is up to them whether or not to report that in the public health app.”",en,neutral,0.875791,negative,0.5811689999999999,"['Google', 'Apple', 'public health']","['North Dakota', 'smartphone', 'smartphones', 'Mobile', 'Bluetooth', 'Alabama', 'Washington', 'public health', 'Public health', 'privacy', 'virus', 'Google', 'Maryland', 'Covid-19', 'coronavirus', 'keyboards', 'Apple', 'U.S', 'Doug Burgum', 'Washington Post-University of Maryland']","['contact', 'technology', 'coronavirus', 'public', 'health', 'release', 'Google', 'mobile', 'Apple', 'apps', 'public health', 'mobile apps', 'exposure', 'users', 'person', 'Dakota', 'companies', 'virus', 'North', 'smartphone', 'number', 'North Dakota', 'smartphones', 'Mobile', 'Bluetooth', 'Alabama', 'Washington', 'Public health', 'privacy', 'Maryland', 'Covid-19', 'keyboards']","['#AppleInc', '#Google', '#PublicHealth', '#Coronavirus', '#NorthDakota', '#Virus', '#Smartphone', '#Alabama', '#MobileAlabama', '#Bluetooth', '#KeyboardInstrument', '#Washington', '#Maryland', '#Privacy']",10,14,378,2246,2020-05-20 21:12:14+00:00,USA Today,"{'avatar_url': None, 'id': 943921, 'name': 'Usa Today'}","{'sentences': ['Apple and Google are releasing contact tracing technology to '

3004938261,Tech giants Facebook and Amazon notch all-time highs in intraday trading,"Shares of Facebook and Amazon both hit all-time highs in intraday trading Wednesday amid a broader market rally.  




Facebook surged more than 6% Wednesday to a record high of about $230 per share. The company announced a day earlier it would roll out Facebook and Instagram shops starting Wednesday. 
The new tool means that consumers can shop and make purchases on their favorite stores' Facebook and Instagram pages as many small business' physical stores remain closed due to the coronavirus pandemic. It marks the largest move into e-commerce yet for the company.
Amazon shares also hit a record high on Wednesday, surging as much as 1.5% to nearly $2,490 per share. Tech stocks have largely outperformed amid the coronavirus crisis as investors have bet on their solid long-term performance. Amazon has also gained as consumers turned to the online giant to stock up on essentials amid the pandemic.

Now, the Nasdaq is trading only about 5% lower than its all-time high close on February 19.

Google's G-Suite has revolutionized the world of office applications, allowing multiple users to collaborate on the same documents, spreadsheets, slideshows, and more. It hasn't only been great for businesses, but also schools and students, as well as those working on creative projects.
Google first introduced the G-Suite way back in 2006 but has been innovating and improving on it ever since. One of the suite's latest features is Google Jamboard.
Google released Jamboard in 2016 as an interactive, collaborative, online whiteboard that allows teams of all sorts to share notes, thoughts, and ideas in a freeform manner without needing to be in the same room. In short, it's a cloud-based whiteboard.

If you want to use Google Jamboard in all its glory, with a physical, 55-inch digital whiteboard for your team to all view at once, it won't be cheap. The 4K UHD display, which comes with two styluses, one eraser, and a wall mount, costs $4,999, plus a $600 annual management and support fee. If you're a teacher, and a G-Suite for Education customer, you get a bit of a discount, because you only have to pay that management fee one time. 




If cost is an issue, the cool thing about Jamboard is that you don't actually need the display to use the application. Anybody can create and share a Jamboard session from their laptop or mobile device, the same way that they can create and share a Google Doc or Sheet.
Here's how to do it.
Check out the products mentioned in this article:
1. On your Drive's home screen, click the New button in the top left corner.

      
      
        
          After accessing Google Drive, click New.

3. You can now use the digital whiteboard to write and draw, as well as add images and sticky notes. If you share it with others, they'll be able to do the same in real-time —no extra devices required.

      
      
        
          Use Google Jamboard as a digital whiteboard.

Available for both Android devices and iPhones, the API relies on each handheld’s Bluetooth radio to ping and detect other smartphones within a relatively short radius.


It would also rely on people opting in to the program: both to receive notifications, and for people to privately report their positive coronavirus diagnosis. In a joint statement, Apple and Google said the software would not collect or use a phone’s GPS or location data.


“User adoption is key to success and we believe that these strong privacy protections are also the best way to encourage use of these apps,” the two tech giants said in their release. 


Apple and Google do not plan to develop the apps themselves, but will instead provide support to public health agencies—though they previously announced plans to eventually bake the features into their respective smartphone platforms. So far, they have been in touch with many U.S. states and over 20 countries interested in the program, they said.

3004937409,‘God’s Own Country’ Director Says Film Has Been “Censored” On Amazon Prime,"Francis Lee, the UK filmmaker whose 2017 romantic feature God’s Own Country was a breakout indie hit, has claimed that his film has been “censored” on Amazon Prime U.S..

The Brit took to twitter to say that the version available was “not the film I intended or made” and that he was asking Amazon to investigate. He later posted a follow-up tweet suggesting that it was the intimate sex scenes in the film – which depicts a relationship between a young farmer played by Josh O’Connor (now of The Crown fame) and a migrant worker played by Alec Secăreanu – that had been altered against his wishes.

	


“I’m interested if any of you have evidence of @PrimeVideo (Amazon Prime USA) censoring naked women or intimate/sex scenes within heterosexual stories on their streaming service? Or if they just censor queer stories?” Lee wrote.

Deadline has asked Amazon for clarity on the situation.

God’s Own Country debuted at Sundance in 2017, winning the world cinema directing prize. It went on to be BAFTA nominated and secure a U.S. release with Orion Pictures.

Lee recently directed the Kate Winslet and Saoirse Ronan romance Ammonite, which was expected to debut at Cannes this year before the fest was cancelled by coronavirus.

3005017986,Apple and Google Unveil Covid Tracking Technology,"(CN) — Apple and Google rolled out new technology Wednesday that public health authorities can use to build their own contact tracing apps to help stop the spread of the novel coronavirus Covid-19.

The long-awaited software uses Bluetooth signals to detect when Android and Apple device users come close to one another. It will only work for users who have downloaded a contact tracing app that utilizes the technology.

“User adoption is key to success,” Apple and Google said in a joint statement Wednesday.

If someone is diagnosed with Covid-19, that person can report the diagnosis through the app. App users who came into contact with that person will then be notified immediately. Each user has the choice to opt in to receiving exposure notifications.

According to the two companies, 22 countries and three states plan to build apps using this new technology. Alabama, North Dakota and South Carolina were the first states to publicly announce they will use the software.

“We invite other states to join us in leveraging smartphone technologies to strengthen existing contact tracing efforts, which are critical to getting communities and economies back up and running,” North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum said in a statement.

The two companies said they sought input and guidance from public health officials, scientists, privacy groups and government leaders around the world as they worked to develop the software over the last several weeks.

Both companies noted safeguards that were adopted to protect users’ privacy. Each user’s identity will remain anonymous. No GPS location data will be used, and the data will stay on each user’s device rather than going to a centralized database controlled by a government authority.

“We believe that these strong privacy protections are also the best way to encourage use of these apps,” the companies said in a statement.

The partnership between the two rival technology giants is unprecedented, but the collaboration was necessary to ensure tracking apps can work for both Android and Apple device users. It will make it easier for iPhones and Android phones to detect each other, work across national and regional borders and fix some problems that led previous apps to quickly drain a phone’s battery.

Both companies said they are not trying to replace traditional contact tracing, an accepted infection control method which involves trained public health workers reaching out to people who may have been exposed to an infected person. Rather, the automatic “exposure notification” system is meant to augment that process and slow the spread of Covid-19 by making people aware of potential exposures so they can get tested and avoid activities that could help spread the virus.

North Dakota had previously launched a location tracking app that was used by about 4% of state residents. While that rate of acceptance is higher than in states with similar apps, it still falls short of what experts say is needed to make the technology useful.

Tim Brookins, the CEO of ProudCrowd, the startup that developed North Dakota’s app, said Wednesday that North Dakotans will now be asked to download two complementary apps — his model, to help public health workers track where Covid-19 patients have been, and the Apple-Google model, to privately notify people who might have been exposed to the virus.

Apple and Google released software on Wednesday that will allow public health agencies around the world to build their own apps to track who may have been exposed to Covid-19 using bluetooth signals, with Alabama, North Dakota and South Carolina the first U.S. states to sign on.

KEY FACTS
 
 
 Apple and Google won’t build apps themselves, but have instead released the underlying technology that allows public health authorities to create their own contact tracing apps to download in the Apple Store or Google Play Store.
 
 Alabama, North Dakota and South Carolina are the first U.S. states to commit to using Apple and Google’s technology, along with 22 countries, including Ireland, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands.
 
  
 The Apple and Google contact tracing system will use bluetooth signals to exchange anonymous “keys” between phones that are in close proximity with each other; if someone is later diagnosed with Covid-19, they can enter their positive test result into an app and alert all the other phones that were near that “key” recently.
 
 The app has stringent privacy measures in place, such as not using location data and storing data on user devices rather than a centralized database overseen by a government authority—but some states and countries, such as the U.K., have complained that those measures make the app less effective.
 
  

 
Crucial quote
 
“North Dakota is excited to be among the first states in the nation to utilize the exposure notification technology built by Apple and Google to help keep our citizens safe,” Gov. Doug Burgum said in a statement. “As we respond to this unprecedented public health emergency, we invite other states to join us in leveraging smartphone technologies to strengthen existing contact tracing efforts, which are critical to getting communities and economies back up and running.”
 
key background
 
Public health experts say identifying and isolating infected people and their contacts will be necessary as countries begin to reopen their economies, though some say that while technology can help with the process, it is no substitute for hiring thousands of contract tracers, humans who are trained to track down and notify people who have been potentially exposed. The Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security estimates that the US needs to hire roughly 100,000 human contact tracers to be effective.
 
news peg
 
Other countries have opted to launch their own contact tracing apps without using Google and Apple’s technology, including China, India, Australia and Israel. Only China and India have mandated citizens use the app, which has led to widespread use, but those apps have still been scrutinized for privacy practices. Utah, too, has built its own contact tracing app that uses GPS location data, unlike Apple and Google.
 
what to watch out for
 
Adoption will be a challenge: Oxford University researchers say contact tracing apps have to be downloaded by 60% of the population in order to be effective, and it remains to be seen if Apple/Google’s effort will get that much buy-in.

3005019207,"Apple, Google release smartphone technology to notify users of possible exposure to coronavirus","Apple and Google on Wednesday released long-awaited smartphone technology to automatically notify people if they might have been exposed to the coronavirus.The companies said 22 countries and several U.S. states are already planning to build voluntary phone apps using their software. It relies on Bluetooth wireless technology to detect when someone who downloaded the app has spent time near another app user who later tests positive for the virus.Many governments have already tried, mostly unsuccessfully, to roll out their own phone apps to fight the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. Many of those apps have encountered technical problems on Apple and Android phones and haven't been widely adopted. They often use GPS to track people's location, which Apple and Google are banning from their new tool because of privacy and accuracy concerns.Public health agencies from Germany to the states of Alabama and South Carolina have been waiting to use the Apple-Google model, while other governments have said the tech giants' privacy restrictions will be a hindrance because public health workers will have no access to the data.The companies said they're not trying to replace contact tracing, a pillar of infection control that involves trained public health workers reaching out to people who may have been exposed to an infected person. But they said their automatic ""exposure notification"" system can augment that process and slow the spread of COVID-19 by virus carriers who are interacting with strangers and aren't yet showing symptoms.The identity of app users will be protected by encryption and anonymous identifier beacons that change frequently.""User adoption is key to success and we believe that these strong privacy protections are also the best way to encourage use of these apps,"" the companies said in a joint statement Wednesday.The companies said the new technology - the product of a rare partnership between the rival tech giants - solves some of the main technical challenges that governments have had in building Bluetooth-based apps. It will make it easier for iPhones and Android phones to detect each other, work across national and regional borders and fix some of the problems that led previous apps to quickly drain a phone's battery.The statement Wednesday also included remarks from state officials in North Dakota, Alabama and South Carolina signaling that they plan to use it.""We invite other states to join us in leveraging smartphone technologies to strengthen existing contact tracing efforts, which are critical to getting communities and economies back up and running,"" said North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, a Republican.North Dakota had already launched a location-tracking app that about 4% of state residents are using, higher than other U.S. states with similar apps but falling far short of the participation rate that experts say is needed to make such technology useful.Tim Brookins, the CEO of ProudCrowd, a startup that developed North Dakota's app, said Wednesday that North Dakotans will now be asked to download two complementary apps - his model, to help public health workers track where COVID-19 patients have been, and the Apple-Google model, to privately notify people who might have been exposed to the virus.Some privacy advocates have favored the Google-Apple approach because it offers more privacy and security. But others, including Ryan Calo, a law professor who co-directs the University of Washington's Tech Policy Lab, said he is concerned about its effectiveness if people get too many false alerts asking them to quarantine themselves. He said public health agencies would be better off being able to track location with careful safeguards.Calo said Google and Apple have been more upfront about the limitations of their model, but he said he's still worried some governments will treat it as a substitute for crucial investments in free, widespread testing and hiring an army of human contact tracers.""We're just not going to get out of this global pandemic with a clever app,"" he said.",en,neutral,0.829491,neutral,0.702737,"['Google', 'Apple', 'smartphone']","['North Dakota', 'smartphone', 'CEO', 'Bluetooth', 'Alabama', 'infection control', 'encryption', 'Washington', 'GPS', 'quarantine', 'wireless', 'Android', 'public health', 'privacy', 'substitute', 'virus', 'Google', 'pandemic', 'Germany', 'COVID-19', 'South Carolina', 'Apple', 'U.S', 'iPhones', 'Doug Burgum', 'Tim Brookins', 'Ryan Calo', 'Calo', 'ProudCrowd', 'Google-Apple', ""University of Washington's Tech Policy Lab""]","['smartphone', 'technology', 'users', 'release', 'exposure', 'Google', 'Apple', 'coronavirus', 'phone apps', 'apps', 'privacy', 'people', 'phone', 'governments', 'contact', 'health', 'companies', 'user', 'model', 'Dakota', 'tech', 'North', 'COVID-19', 'North Dakota', 'CEO', 'Bluetooth', 'Alabama', 'infection control', 'encryption', 'Washington', 'GPS', 'quarantine', 'wireless', 'Android', 'public health', 'substitute', 'virus', 'pandemic', 'Germany', 'South Carolina']","['#AppleInc', '#Privacy', '#Google', '#PublicHealth', '#Smartphone', '#NorthDakota', '#Pandemic', '#Android', '#Alabama', '#SouthCarolina', '#Coronavirus', '#Bluetooth', '#Wireless', '#GPS', '#GlobalPositioningSystem', '#Germany', '#InfectionControl', '#Virus', '#Encryption', '#CEO', '#ChiefExecutiveOfficer', '#Washington', '#Quarantine', '#Substitute']",1,22,674,4056,2020-05-21 01:33:22+00:00,ABC7,"{'avatar_url': None, 'id': 950087, 'name': 'Ap'}","{'sentences': ['Apple and Google on Wednesday released long-awaited smartphone '

3004812371,Google Pixel 5 once again rumored to feature a mid-range Snapdragon 765 SoC,"Source: Harish Jonnalagadda/Android Central


In March this year, a teardown of the Google Camera app had suggested the Pixel 5 may not be powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon 865 processor. More evidence suggesting the same has now surfaced, courtesy of the folks at XDA Developers.

XDA Developers found a new reference to an upcoming Pixel device in the pre-installed EUICCGoogle APK in Android 11 Developer Preview 4. The reference includes Google's codename for the Snapdragon 765 chipset, corroborating the evidence found in March. However, the reference doesn't confirm that it will be the Snapdragon 765 chipset that will power the Pixel 5. The upcoming phone could also be powered by the gaming-focused Snapdragon 765G or 768G chips, both of which are pin and software compatible.

In addition to the new reference found by XDA, David Ruddock, Editor-in-Chief of Android Police has also claimed via his own source that the Pixel 5 will feature the Snapdragon 765 chipset.



The evidence is certainly not surprising, as a recent Google survey hinted at the possibility of the Pixel 5 undercutting most 2020 Android flagship phones by a few hundred dollars. While the Snapdragon 765 chipset may disappoint a few buyers, the Pixel 5 could still be able to attract some buyers with a $699 price tag and best-in-class camera performance. Whether or not Google will get all the basics right with Pixel 5, however, remains to be seen.

Sadly, Pixel phones remain a tiny piece of Google's hardware strategy

3005012202,"Patent Issued for Haptic Electromagnetic Actuator (USPTO 10,642,361): Apple Inc.","2020 MAY 20 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Electronics Business Daily -- From Alexandria, Virginia, NewsRx journalists report that a patent by the inventors Kessler, Patrick (San Francisco, CA); Patel, Dhaval Chandrakant (San Jose, CA); Harley, Jonah A. (Los Gatos, CA); Degner, Brett W. (Menlo Park, CA); Rundle, Nicholas Alan (San Jose, CA); Augenbergs, Peteris K. (Woodside, CA); Lubinski, Nicholaus (San Francisco, CA); Staton, Kenneth L (San Carlos, CA); Leung, Omar Sze (Palo Alto, CA), filed on October 30, 2017, was published online on May 18, 2020.

The patent’s assignee for patent number 10,642,361 is Apple Inc. (Cupertino, California, United States).

News editors obtained the following quote from the background information supplied by the inventors: “Haptics is a tactile feedback technology which pertains to the sense of touch by applying forces, vibrations or motions to a user. This mechanical stimulation may be used to provide tactile feedback in response to an input command or system state. Haptic devices may incorporate actuators that apply forces or motion to the skin for providing touch feedback. One example of a haptic actuator provides mechanical motion in response to an electrical stimulus. Most haptic feedback mechanisms use mechanical technologies such as vibratory motors, like a vibrating alert in a cell phone, in which a central mass is moved to create vibrations at a resonant frequency. The kinetic energy of these vibrations may be sensed by a user. These motors provide strong feedback, but produce a limited range of sensations.

“There remains a need for developing actuators with flat shape, but sufficient travel distance or working distance and sufficient force and fast response.”

As a supplement to the background information on this patent, NewsRx correspondents also obtained the inventors’ summary information for this patent: “Embodiments described herein may provide a flat actuator which generates relatively large travel distance and high magnetic force. The disclosure provides methods for fabricating the actuator from a flat laminated metal sheet. Such fabrication methods may be cost effective and may provide the dimensional precision as needed.

“In an embodiment, a haptic electromagnetic actuator for trackpad is provided. The actuator includes an array of electromagnets with alternating South and North poles on a first end, each magnet comprising a metal core and an electrical wire around the metal core. The array of magnets is coupled to a base plate on a second end opposite to the first end. The actuator also includes an attraction plate at a distance from the first end of the array of the magnets such that the attraction plate moves toward the magnets when an electrical current flows through the electrical wire around the metal core and moves away from the magnets when the current becomes zero. The array of magnets is configured to form a uniform gap from the attraction plate.

“In another embodiment, a track pad is provided to include a haptic electromagnetic actuator. The track pad includes a housing, and a track plate coupled to the housing by bending beams. The track pad also includes an actuator having a baseplate coupled to the housing on a first end. The baseplate supports an array of electromagnets with alternating South and North poles on a second end opposite to the first end. The actuator has an attraction plate coupled to the track plate.

“In a further embodiment, a method is provided for fabricating an actuator. The method includes providing a laminated sheet metal and stamping the sheet metal to an array of metal cores with a support base. The method also includes annealing the sheet metal. The method further includes placing electrical wires around the metal cores, and soldering two ends of each wire to the support base.

3004957294,Apple and Google Release Smartphone Technology for Coronavirus Exposure Notification System,"By Matt O'Brien

Apple and Google on Wednesday released long-awaited smartphone technology to automatically notify people if they might have been exposed to the coronavirus.

The companies said 22 countries and several U.S. states are already planning to build voluntary phone apps using their software. It relies on Bluetooth wireless technology to detect when someone who downloaded the app has spent time near another app user who later tests positive for the virus.

Many governments have already tried, mostly unsuccessfully, to roll out their own phone apps to fight the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. Many of those apps have encountered technical problems on Apple and Android phones and haven’t been widely adopted. They often use GPS to track people’s location, which Apple and Google are banning from their new tool because of privacy and accuracy concerns.

Public health agencies from Germany to the states of Alabama and South Carolina have been waiting to use the Apple-Google model, while other governments have said the tech giants’ privacy restrictions will be a hindrance because public health workers will have no access to the data.

The companies said they’re not trying to replace contact tracing, a pillar of infection control that involves trained public health workers reaching out to people who may have been exposed to an infected person. But they said their automatic “exposure notification” system can augment that process and slow the spread of COVID-19 by virus carriers who are interacting with strangers and aren’t yet showing symptoms.

The identity of app users will be protected by encryption and anonymous identifier beacons that change frequently.

“User adoption is key to success and we believe that these strong privacy protections are also the best way to encourage use of these apps,” the companies said in a joint statement Wednesday.

The companies said the new technology — the product of a rare partnership between the rival tech giants — solves some of the main technical challenges that governments have had in building Bluetooth-based apps. It will make it easier for iPhones and Android phones to detect each other, work across national and regional borders and fix some of the problems that led previous apps to quickly drain a phone’s battery.

The statement Wednesday also included remarks from state officials in North Dakota, Alabama and South Carolina signaling that they plan to use it.

“We invite other states to join us in leveraging smartphone technologies to strengthen existing contact tracing efforts, which are critical to getting communities and economies back up and running,” said North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, a Republican.

North Dakota had already launched a location-tracking app that about 4% of state residents are using, higher than other U.S. states with similar apps but falling far short of the participation rate that experts say is needed to make such technology useful.

Tim Brookins, the CEO of ProudCrowd, a startup that developed North Dakota’s app, said Wednesday that North Dakotans will now be asked to download two complementary apps — his model, to help public health workers track where COVID-19 patients have been, and the Apple-Google model, to privately notify people who might have been exposed to the virus.

3004939359,"Apple and Google launch exposure notification API, enabling public health authorities to release apps –","Apple  and Google  today made available the first public version of their exposure notification API, which was originally debuted as a joint-contact tracing software tool. The partners later renamed it the Exposure Notification system to more accurately reflect its functionality, which is designed to notify individuals of potential exposure to others who have confirmed cases of COVID-19, while preserving privacy around identifying info and location data.

The launch today means that public health agencies can now use the API  in apps released to the general public. To date, Apple and Google have only released beta versions of the API to help developed with the development process.

To be clear, this launch means that developers working on behalf of public health agencies can now issue apps that make use of it – Apple and Google themselves are not creating an exposure notification or contact tracing app. The companies say that many U.S. states and 22 countries across five continents have already asked for, and been provided access to the API to support their development efforts, and they anticipate more being added going forward. So far, Apple and Google say they have conducted over 24 briefings and tech talks for public health officials, epidemiologists, and app developers working on their behalf.

The exposure notification API works using a decentralized identifier system that uses randomly generated temporary keys created on a user’s device (but not tied to their specific identify or info). Apple and Google’s API allows public health agencies to define what constitutes potential exposure in terms of exposed time and distance, and they can tweak transmission risk and other factors according to their own standards.

Further, Apple and Google will allow apps to make use of a combination of the API and voluntarily submitted user data that they provide through individual apps to enable public health authorities to contact exposure users directly to make them aware of what steps they should take.

During the course of the API’s development, Apple and Google have made various improvements to ensure that privacy is an utmost consideration, including encrypting all Bluetooth metadata (like signal strength and specific transmitting power) since that could potentially be used to determine what type of device was used, which offers a slim possibility of associating an individual with a specific device and using that as one vector for identification.

The companies have also explicitly barred use of the API in any apps that also seek geolocation information permission from users – which means some apps being developed by public health authorities for contact tracing that use geolocation data won’t be able to access the exposure notification API. That has prompted some to reconsider their existing approach.

Apple and Google provided the following joint statement about the API and how it will support contact tracing efforts undertaken by public health officials and agencies:

One of the most effective techniques that public health officials have used during outbreaks is called contact tracing. Through this approach, public health officials contact, test, treat and advise people who may have been exposed to an affected person. One new element of contact tracing is Exposure Notifications: using privacy-preserving digital technology to tell someone they may have been exposed to the virus. Exposure Notification has the specific goal of rapid notification, which is especially important to slowing the spread of the disease with a virus that can be spread asymptomatically.

To help, Apple and Google cooperated to build Exposure Notifications technology that will enable apps created by public health agencies to work more accurately, reliably and effectively across both Android  phones and iPhones. Over the last several weeks, our two companies have worked together, reaching out to public health officials scientists, privacy groups and government leaders all over the world to get their input and guidance.

Starting today, our Exposure Notifications technology is available to public health agencies on both iOS and Android. What we’ve built is not an app — rather public health agencies will incorporate the API into their own apps that people install. Our technology is designed to make these apps work better. Each user gets to decide whether or not to opt-in to Exposure Notifications; the system does not collect or use location from the device; and if a person is diagnosed with COVID-19, it is up to them whether or not to report that in the public health app. User adoption is key to success and we believe that these strong privacy protections are also the best way to encourage use of these apps.

Today, this technology is in the hands of public health agencies across the world who will take the lead and we will continue to support their efforts.

The companies previously announced plans to make Exposure Notification a system-level feature in a later update to both their respective mobile operating systems, to be released sometime later this year. That ‘Phase two’ portion of the strategy might be under revision, however, as Google and Apple said they continue to be in conversation with public health authorities about what system-level features will be useful to them in development of their COVID-19 mitigation strategies.",en,neutral,0.91199,positive,0.884958,"['Google', 'Apple', 'public health', 'API']","['geolocation', 'Bluetooth', 'encrypting', 'asymptomatically', 'Android', 'metadata', 'iOS', 'API', 'public health', 'privacy', 'virus', 'Google', 'digital', 'COVID-19', 'epidemiologists', 'Apple', 'U.S', 'iPhones', 'Further', 'Exposure Notifications']","['notification', 'public', 'exposure', 'launch', 'health', 'Google', 'authorities', 'Apple', 'apps', 'public health', 'API', 'Exposure Notifications', 'exposure notification', 'Exposure Notification', 'exposure users', 'privacy', 'development', 'specific', 'user', 'system', 'signal strength', 'geolocation', 'Bluetooth', 'encrypting', 'asymptomatically', 'vector', 'Android', 'metadata', 'iOS', 'virus', 'digital', 'COVID-19', 'epidemiologists']","['#PublicHealth', '#API', '#ApplicationProgrammingInterface', '#AppleInc', '#Google', '#Privacy', '#Geolocation', '#Virus', '#Android', '#Epidemiology', '#Encryption', '#Bluetooth', '#Metadata', '#SignalStrengthInTelecommunications', '#EuclideanVector', '#DigitalTerrestrialTelevision', '#Asymptote', '#IOS']",13,27,864,5397,2020-05-20 17:01:59+00:00,TechCrunch,"{'avatar_url': None, 'id': 487732, 'name': 'Darrell Etherington'}","{'sentences': ['To be clear, this launch means that developers working on '

The statement Wednesday also included remarks from state officials in North Dakota, Alabama and South Carolina signaling that they plan to use it.

3004848128,"Consumers Energy Providing 100,000 Google Nest Thermostats to Michigan Households During Pandemic","JACKSON, Michigan, May 20 -- Consumers Energy issued the following news release:
Consumers Energy announced a partnership with Google and Uplight to provide Google Nest thermostats to up to 100,000 households, helping Michigan residents power through the COVID-19 pandemic by saving energy and money.
""Consumers Energy is committed to Michigan's success, and we're excited to help so many of our friends and neighbors during these challenging times by putting this powerful technology into their hands at no cost,"" said Patti Poppe, Consumers Energy's president and CEO. ""We want to give our customers more control to manage their energy use, helping reduce their bills while protecting the environment.""
This offer is part of Consumers Energy's Clean Energy Plan, which will eliminate coal and achieve net-zero carbon emissions. Google and Uplight are helping Consumers Energy provide the Google Nest Thermostat E to customers through July 31.
""As we work to protect and support all Michiganders during the COVID-19 pandemic, this is a great tool to help families keep their utility bills down,"" said Lieutenant Governor Garlin Gilchrist II. ""I commend Consumers Energy, Google and Uplight for this innovative partnership, which helps people save money and is another step for our state toward a cleaner energy future.""
Consumers Energy is making energy-saving benefits available to all of its residential customers:
* Electric customers who receive smart thermostats will be enrolled in the Smart Thermostat Program, which shifts energy usage to off-peak hours -- while also keeping households comfortable - on a few days each year.
* Natural gas-only customers also can receive the thermostats.
* Households that aren't eligible for a Google Nest Thermostat E can receive a free Consumers Energy Care Package, which includes four LED bulbs and three night lights, and are enrolled in the Peak Time Rewards program, which provides payments for shifting energy use away from late afternoons in the summer.
Consumers Energy customers can learn more and receive thermostats at ConsumersEnergy.com/freethermostat.
Consumers Energy is actively encouraging customers to shift their energy use away from peak times, typically 2-7 p.m. weekdays in the summer, when demand rises and electricity is more expensive to provide.
""We need Michigan to take action to protect the environment and help us avoid building three new power plants over the next generation,"" Poppe said. ""By giving away 100,000 thermostats with Google and Uplight, we're demonstrating that not only can we protect the environment, but we can also help reduce costs for the communities we serve at a time when they need it most.""

3004976149,"Google, Apple, release joint coronavirus tracking technology","Apple and Google have released their joint smartphone technology that will alert users if they might have been exposed to COVID-19. The companies announce the plan more than a month ago, but have had to tweak their approach along the way due to privacy concerns.

The technology is now available to developers to create apps, which the companies say is already beginning in 22 countries and several U.S. states.

The apps will be voluntary, and users would enter whether they have tested positive for COVID-19. The technology will use the bluetooth function to detect if people have come in contact with those users who have tested positive. It will not reveal the identity of the user. The effectiveness of the apps will be determined by whether people decide to download and use them.

“User adoption is key to success and we believe that these strong privacy protections are also the best way to encourage use of these apps,” the companies said in a joint statement Wednesday.

The partnership solves problems municipalities have had trying to develop their own apps because it will make it easier for iPhones and Android devices to detect each other. They will also work across national and regional borders and fix some of the problems that led previous apps to quickly drain a phone’s battery.

The companies say the apps will not replace contact tracing, which is an important part of plans to reopen cities. The ability to monitor a potential outbreak could give authorities smaller, more specific areas to watch or respond to rather than employing the social-distancing approach being used now. The companies say this technology is only meant to enhance that ability to by pointing people in the right direction in a more timely manner.

""We invite other states to join us in leveraging smartphone technologies to strengthen existing contact tracing efforts, which are critical to getting communities and economies back up and running,” North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum said in the joint Google/Apple statement.

3004939340,"Apple and Google are making their COVID-19 exposure tech available to public health agencies, which means you'll soon have access to contact tracing apps","Apple and Google are rolling out their exposure notification API so that public health agencies can start including the technology in their apps.
22 countries have been given access to the API along with ""a number"" of US states, the companies said.
It's the first major phase of the technology. Apple and Google have spent weeks finessing the privacy elements of the app, as well as improving the level of control for public health agencies.
Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.





Apple and Google have started rolling out their COVID-19 contact tracing tech in a publicly available software update, meaning public health agencies can start building it into apps.
The arrival of the application programming interface (API) – which Apple and Google now officially call the exposure notifications system – means public health agencies can begin to roll out their own contact tracing apps to users.
The software will use Bluetooth to detect other smartphones in close proximity and alert the user – assuming they have a relevant health app installed – if they come into contact with someone who tested positive for COVID-19.
The companies said that 22 countries on five continents have received access to the API, along with ""a number"" of US states. More locations will get access in the coming weeks, Apple and Google said.




Spokespeople for Google and Apple said that in most cases the API will only be available to one app per country, but said exceptions could be made. However, this does not appear to be the case for the US, where individual states are creating their own apps.
Apple and Google consulted with several public health groups to finesse the API, including the CDC Foundation, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the Association of Public Health Laboratories.
Off the back of those talks, the API has been tweaked with several improvements for health agencies, including letting agencies themselves decide what constitutes ""an exposure event"" between people, and determine the level of risk from instances of someone coming into contact with a person who has tested positive for COVID-19.
The companies said they will continue to update and improve the API as they get feedback from public health authorities.




Earlier this month, Apple and Google gave us a preview of what the interface might look like on iPhones and Android smartphones. It also recently announced it had tightened some of the privacy controls around the tech, including encrypting the data that gets shared via Bluetooth.
But the bigger challenge will be for public health agencies to get people to download their apps. One study has suggested that 60% of the population would need to adopt these apps for the technology to be effective, but according to a Washington Post-University of Maryland poll, nearly three in five Americans said they would be unwilling or unable to use Google and Apple's contact tracing technology.
The UK is currently trialing its own NHS contract tracking app, which has been criticized by cybersecurity researchers who discovered several security risks.
However, it was recently reported that the NHS could be working on a separate app that uses Google and Apple's API.

3004945711,Google AI system can assess risk of AMD development: Google recently developed an AI system that detects age-related macular degeneration in the eye and demonstrates the potential to predict the disease's progression.,"Google recently developed an AI system that detects age-related macular degeneration in the eye and demonstrates the potential to predict the disease's progression.

AMD, the country's most prevalent cause of sight loss, manifests as ""dry"" in most patients. However, about 15 percent of patients experience ""wet"" AMD, which is more sight-threatening and occurs when abnormal blood vessels appear underneath the retina. This can lead to permanent vision loss if not treated early.

The AI system involves two deep convolutional neural networks, one inputting raw 3D scans and the other taking a segmentation map detailing the types of tissue in the retina. The prediction tool uses this data to estimate a patient's risk of developing wet AMD.

The time frame before wet AMD develops is crucial for preventive care, and Google's AI tool has shown potential to predict whether a patient with wet AMD in one eye will develop it in their second eye within six months.

3004869620,"'Crucible,' Amazon's bid to enter the competitive shooter space, wants to be ‘a gamer's game’","Amazon is a giant. Of course. And that is why the company is being careful, says the game industry veteran overseeing the launch of the company's first major video game, to not look as if it is wielding all of its might. ""Crucible,"" available Wednesday for PCs, is a free-to-play, competitive, team-based online shooter, one that wants to endear itself to players with approachable tweaks to the familiar rather than a full upending of any genre. It's entering a landscape dominated by the likes of ""Fortnite,"" ""Overwatch"" and ""Apex Legends,"" and intermixes the shooter-based gameplay of the battle royale genre, playing with more strategic, character-leveling elements found in multiplayer online battle arenas such as ""League of Legends."" ""The kind of game that we're making is a gamer's game, for sure,"" says Louis Castle, who leads Amazon's Relentless Studios in Seattle and is a longtime game designer/executive whose credits range from interactive adaptations of Disney's ""The Lion King"" to the ""Command & Conquer"" series. Castle knows that anything that carries the Amazon name won't exactly be a little word-of-mouth entry. The company, a powerhouse in providing back-end game server tech, also owns streaming service Twitch. And while Castle stresses that making ""Crucible"" ""watchable"" was a paramount goal, he says Amazon is not making an immediate push for the sci-fi game to enter, for instance, the esport arena. ""We're very cognizant of the fact that we're new to the space and we're new to the category. We've done our best and we've made a nice game. We think it's good and we expect it to change and grow ... I'm always fond of the saying that 'you can't push a rope.' It's the community that pushes you into the esport arena,"" says Castle. ""That's not something we can engineer. There are many people in our alpha [testing] group who are excited by its potential, so I don't want to say that we wouldn't support it, but that's not something we're going to go out and claim."" Many have been watching Amazon's quest to enter the consumer-facing game-playing space. When Castle joined the company in 2017, ""Crucible"" was already in development. In that time, an announced brawler called ""Breakaway"" was killed, and a companion game to ""The Grand Tour"" series was met with a tepid response. After ""Crucible,"" in August Amazon will release ""New World,"" an online role-playing game. ""Both teams have been working for a long time on these games,"" says Castle. ""I imagine there will be expectations set because this is the first one, but they will be quickly changed because 'New World' is nothing like 'Crucible.'"" Castle isn't trying to pretend that ""Crucible"" is some family-friendly, game-for-everyone that can speak to the increased focus on the medium's ability to connect during this pandemic moment. So while ""Crucible"" has an anthropomorphic rodent — Tosca is her name, and she's a master at sarcasm and shooting an acid gun — as well a chipper robot with an interest in botany and mayhem, ""Crucible"" is designed to be a game whose characters have deep skill sets that will require time to master. While Relentless Studios didn't set out to make a game that would require the highest of the high-end PCs to run, it will still need a relatively decent machine to play. This pays off somewhat in the game's style, says Castle. The team wanted a game that was bright and detailed, and one that showed off the personality of its diverse, animated character roster, which features a broad mix of genders, species and races. Its 10 core playable characters at launch range from Ajonah, a blue-toned, ""Avatar""-influenced sharpshooting alien with connections to nature, to the flame-throwing female warrior Summer to the more jovial Rahi, whose robot sidekick seems to always bring a smile to Rahi's face. ""We did push the bar to make sure it was something that was really pretty,"" says Castle. ""That means you have to have a reasonably good machine, something within the last couple years, to play this well. We didn't go for an oversimplified art style to make the audience much wider. We felt in the free-to-play space a lot of games just hadn't stepped up when it came to their visual style. That's not a blanket statement, but the art style is a little more whimsical."" There will be three separate game modes at launch, and Castle expects the studio to spend about two months before starting ""Crucible's"" first proper season, which, like competitors in the space, gives players access to limited time rewards. The game will, like ""Fortnite,"" take a cosmetic, character-skin approach to monetization, in adding to selling its season passes (950 in-game credits, which equals $9.50). All of the matches, whether focusing on taking out other teams or capturing the ""hearts"" of an alien life-form called Hives, can shift as players acquire what the game calls ""Essence."" The latter is accrued from completing objectives or battling the environment, allowing players to advance the skill set of the characters. So while ""Crucible's"" modes range from teams of two competing against seven other pairs to be the last group standing to an eight-person versus eight-person match centered on capture and defense, all ask the players to do a mix of environmental exploration. Taking down computer-controlled characters and aliens can be just as vital as harvesting the planet or engaging other players on the opposing team, as Essence will be key to the matches. ""You're dropped into the game fully armed and with all your abilities so you don't start in some way where you have run around frantically looking for a pistol or knife,"" Castle says. ""You start out fully capable, and your character grows during their match. You level up. There are different emergent strategies that happen while you're playing. It rewards the player who has knowledge and is thinking strategically about play.""",en,neutral,0.7631479999999999,positive,0.569,"['Amazon', 'competitive shooter', 'game']","['Fortnite', 'species', 'game server', 'multiplayer', 'word-of-mouth', 'video game', 'Overwatch', 'Seattle', 'Amazon', 'Command & Conquer', 'The Grand Tour', 'Essence', 'Avatar', 'brawler', 'sidekick', 'monetization', 'The Lion King', 'New World', 'arena', 'Twitch', 'Crucible', 'Breakaway', 'Tosca', 'rodent', 'role-playing game', 'Relentless', 'anthropomorphic', 'Disney', 'acid', 'pandemic', 'free-to-play', 'robot', 'sci-fi', 'pistol', 'Apex Legends', 'Louis Castle', 'Relentless Studios', 'Rahi', '""Command & Conquer', 'Castle', 'Ajonah']","['shooter', 'competitive', 'space', 'Amazon', 'gamer', 'Crucible', 'game', 'competitive shooter', 'Castle', 'players', 'characters', 'teams', 'alien', 'time', 'company', 'launch', 'arenas', 'style', 'online', 'Fortnite', 'species', 'game server', 'multiplayer', 'word-of-mouth', 'video game', 'Overwatch', 'Seattle', 'Command & Conquer', 'sharpshooting', 'The Grand Tour', 'Essence', 'Avatar', 'brawler', 'sidekick', 'monetization', 'The Lion King', 'New World', 'arena', 'Twitch', 'Breakaway', 'Tosca', 'rodent', 'role-playing game', 'Relentless', 'anthropomorphic', 'Disney', 'acid', 'pandemic', 'free-to-play', 'robot', 'sci-fi', 'battle royale genre', 'pistol', 'planet']","['#CrucibleTheatre', '#Amazon', '#Freetoplay', '#Fortnite', '#RelentlessRecords', '#Arena', '#NewWorld', '#Robot', '#Essence', '#ShootingSports', '#VideoGame', '#Overwatch', '#BattleRoyaleGame', '#MultiplayerVideoGame', '#Seattle', '#TheWaltDisneyCompany', '#TheLionKing', '#CommandConquer', '#WordOfMouth', '#GameServer', '#Twitchtv', '#ScienceFiction', '#BeatEmUp', '#ListsOfTransformersCharacters', '#TheGrandTour', '#RoleplayingGame', '#Pandemic', '#Anthropomorphism', '#Rodent', '#Tosca', '#Acid', '#Species', '#Avatar', '#Sharpshooter', '#Sidekick', '#Monetization', '#Planet', '#Pistol']",1,43,1051,5897,2020-05-20 12:04:21+00:00,The Los Angeles Times,"{'avatar_url': None, 'id': 1083043, 'name': 'Todd Martens'}","{'sentences': ['""The kind of game that we\'re making is a gamer\'s game, for '

3004988363,"Stock Market Gets Another Lift, Powered By Chip Stocks; Amazon, Facebook Hit All-Time Highs","So much for a weak close for the stock market Tuesday.

Major stock indexes scored solid gains Wednesday and ended near session highs, helped by another bullish rally in semiconductor stocks. Top-performing chip stocks in the Nasdaq 100 included Analog Devices, ASML, Intel and KLA. The common bond among all four? They all topped buy points.

Analog Devices cleared a cup-with-handle base with a 114.16 buy point. Before the open, the chipmaker reported its sixth straight quarter of declining earnings and sales. But Wall Street instead focused on a solid outlook.

ASML, featured in Wednesday's Stock Of The Day, gapped out of a consolidation with a conventional entry of 319.32; group peer KLA cleared a 117.27 buy point and Intel topped a 62.23 entry.

The Philadelphia Semiconductor index broke out over the 1800 level and jumped 3.7%.

Stock Market Today

The Nasdaq composite took out Tuesday's high with ease, rising 2.1%. As noted in the latest Weekend Market Update, the Nasdaq passed a key test last week with a solid bounce off of its 21-day exponential moving average. Now, the index has its sights set on its all-time high of 9838 set in February. It was another accumulation day for the Nasdaq, with volume coming in slightly higher than Tuesday.

The release of Federal Reserve minutes from prior Fed meetings has moved markets in the past, but that wasn't the case Wednesday. The Fed is in a holding pattern for now after implementing $3 trillion in lending and liquidity programs to support the economy. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has made it clear the Fed will do more, if needed, to support the economy.

The S&P 500 rallied 1.7%, but it's about to face a key test at the 3000 level, which basically corresponds to its 200-day moving average. It wouldn't be surprising to see the S&P 500 get turned away at the 3000 level. That can happen when an index tries to conquer a big round number like this.

But the stock market uptrend confirmed by the S&P 500 on April 2 has a lot going for it, so it might not be a tall order for the benchmark index. The 9000 level was a potential resistance level to watch for the Nasdaq, but the leading index powered above it with relative ease.

The Dow Jones Industrial average gained 1.5% as it approaches the 25,000 level. Preliminary data showed NYSE volume coming in slightly higher than Tuesday.

The Russell 2000 small-cap index led the way, up 3%. The iShares Russell 2000 ETF is in position for a breakout try over its April 29 high of 136.84.

Leaders Acting Well

With a light distribution-day count for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq, there's still plenty to like about the confirmed uptrend. Leading growth stocks have been pillars of strength, with several strong performers like Twilio, Datadog, Bandwidth, Wix.com, Inphi and Regeneron trading tightly near highs after breakouts.

Two solid earnings reports in the retail sector from Target and Lowe's fueled positive sentiment early in the session. But both stocks faded from early gains despite big earnings and sales beats and strong digital sales. E-commerce sales at Target soared 141% year over year. Lowe's digital sales jumped 80%.

Headed into Wednesday, the retail sector ranked No. 9 out out of 33 sectors ranked by IBD based on a combination of fundamental and technical factors. Internet retailers like Amazon.com, eBay, Alibaba and JD.com have been performing well.

China-based Alibaba and JD.com came under pressure Wednesday after the Senate passed legislation that could ban Chinese companies from listing shares on U.S. exchanges. But both stocks rallied off lows. Alibaba reports earnings Friday before the open. It's holding just above 216.20 buy point.

FANG Stocks On The Move

Facebook followed through bullishly after Tuesday's breakout from a cup with handle base. The buy point was 215.38. Late Tuesday, Facebook introduced Facebook Shops, where small businesses will be able to sell their products online.

Fellow FANG stock Alphabet, the parent company of Google, is forming a cup with handle base with a 1,415.63 buy point. Amazon scored an all-time high as it tries to move above the 2,500 level. Amazon was raised to full position on Leaderboard Tuesday.

3004938950,"Tech giants Facebook and Amazon notch all-time highs in intraday trading (FB, AMZN) | Markets Insider","FB



Shares of Facebook and Amazon both hit all-time highs in intraday trading Wednesday amid a broader market rally.  

Facebook surged more than 6% Wednesday to a record high of about $230 per share. The company announced a day earlier it would roll out Facebook and Instagram shops starting Wednesday. 

The new tool means that consumers can shop and make purchases on their favorite stores' Facebook and Instagram pages as many small business' physical stores remain closed due to the coronavirus pandemic. It marks the largest move into e-commerce yet for the company.





Amazon shares also hit a record high on Wednesday, surging as much as 1.5% to nearly $2,490 per share. Tech stocks have largely outperformed amid the coronavirus crisis as investors have bet on their solid long-term performance. Amazon has also gained as consumers turned to the online giant to stock up on essentials amid the pandemic.

The strong performance from both stocks has supported the tech-heavy Nasdaq, which has rallied from recent lows on March 23. In early May, the index erased its losses for 2020 as tech stocks surged. 

Now, the Nasdaq is trading only about 5% lower than its all-time high close on February 19.

There haven’t been too many details released about the game since it was first announced, along with three other titles, four years ago at TwitchCon. All that was known was that the competitive PC game was free to download and featured three game modes and 10 characters. Gamespot had a chance to demo the game and described it as “a third-person version of Overwatch meeting Evolve.”
Reviews were not immediately available for the game, but it faced some issues after it’s launch time.

— Crucible (@PlayCrucible) May 20, 2020

The game’s three modes, Heart of Hives, Harvester Command, and Alpha Hunters, all included team play, and teams were made up of either four or eight players. Although all featured multi-player action, the objectives for each mode were very different. In Heart of Hives, the team won if they collected three hearts from a hive before the other. The aim of Harvester Command was for the team to keep their opponents from moving to drain their energy or “essence.” Alpha Hunter had a more severe charge, which was to “fight to the death,” CNET described.
Each mode was fought within the game’s world, Crucible, a hostile environment that featured another central element to the game, essence. The item was the way to get an advantage over the other team. Essence was harvested by killing herds of animals or creating a machine that helps you to draw it from the environment. Having an abundance of the item allowed you to level up in health and made you more lethal. Leveling up helped players to gain an edge over their opponents and was a big part of every mode of Crucible.
Characters and their abilities were a big part of the gameplay. Any role a player chose offered different capabilities. Although every persona offered different strengths, anyone can be an asset to any team. The game had an emphasis “on teamwork and character combinations without the need for building teams based on specific roles,” Gamespot wrote.
Amazon Game Studios, based in Seattle, also has offices in San Diego and Orange County, California. The company launched in 2012. The next titles that are expected to be released are New World, based on the 17th Century, and The Grand Tour Game, which will be based on Lord of the Rings.",en,neutral,0.686148,positive,0.7414,"['Amazon', 'Amazon Releases Sci-Fi Shooter Video Game']","['energy', 'Overwatch', 'San Diego', 'Seattle', 'Evolve', 'The Grand Tour', 'third-person', 'asset', 'Essence', 'PC game', 'Orange County, California', 'New World', 'Gamespot', 'Crucible', 'Relentless', 'sci-fi', 'CNET', 'Orange County', 'California', 'Rings', 'Amazon Game Studios', 'TwitchCon', 'Harvester Command', 'Alpha Hunters', 'Characters']","['Shooter', 'Video', 'Sci-Fi', 'Game', 'Releases', 'Amazon', 'Crucible', 'game Crucible', 'team', 'players', 'modes', 'company', 'essence', 'titles', 'issues', 'characters', 'Studios', 'item', 'environment', 'role', 'opponents', 'energy', 'Overwatch', 'San Diego', 'Seattle', 'Evolve', 'The Grand Tour', 'third-person', 'asset', 'Essence', 'PC game', 'Orange County, California', 'New World', 'Gamespot', 'Relentless', 'sci-fi', 'CNET']","['#CrucibleTheatre', '#PCGame', '#CNET', '#CNET', '#GameSpot', '#Amazon', '#ScienceFiction', '#RelentlessRecords', '#VirtualCameraSystem', '#Overwatch', '#Evolve', '#Energy', '#Essence', '#Asset', '#Seattle', '#SanDiego', '#OrangeCountyCalifornia', '#NewWorld', '#TheGrandTour']",9,26,452,2630,2020-05-20 20:23:26+00:00,Inquisitr,"{'avatar_url': None, 'id': 2600932, 'name': 'Kristen Markel'}","{'sentences': ['Amazon Game Studios released the free PC game Crucible on '

3004914238,"Crucible, Amazon's Shooter/MOBA Game, is Out Right Now","Crucible, Amazon’s first video game, is out today, and the PC shooter is taking aim at giants of the genre.

The game is a team-based multiplayer shooter that draws on some familiar elements from popular games like Overwatch and League of Legends. Here’s how Crucible adds enough of its own ideas to keep things interesting.

At the core of the Crucible experience are the characters.

As in Overwatch, players choose from a selection of “hunters,” each with their own distinct abilities and appearances. There are 10 characters as of launch, filling a variety of roles. If you like to keep your distance, Ajonah has a grappling hook to reach good positions and snipe people with her harpoon gun. For those who like the face-to-face approach, there’s bulky brawler Drakahl. Players who want to support their teammates can pick someone like Mendoza, who can create cover and has medkits.

The hunters start each game with their particular weapons and abilities, but Crucible also has RPG elements, as players choose upgrades that they can unlock as matches progress.

Character-based shooters are common these days, so what sets Crucible apart will probably be the flow of the game. There are three game modes, all set in a massive jungle map, but the main one is Heart of the Hives, where two teams of four race to collect three hive hearts. Unfortunately, the only way to get the hearts is to loot them from hives that spew out wild enemies.

By tossing in a faction of monsters for both teams to deal with, Crucible creates an element of chaos that other team-based shooters might lack. It’s reminiscent of multiplayer online battle arena games like Dota 2 and League of Legends that continue to dominate the Steam charts.

In addition to the hives, there are other objectives around the map that teams can make a run at to level up and better arm themselves for their next fight.

By Money Morning Staff Reports, Money Morning • May 20, 2020
Stocks rose sharply today as investors bet on a successful economic recovery with more states easing their stay-at-home policies.
Facebook Inc. (NASDAQ: FB) and Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) led the way, both closing at new all-time highs.
The Dow was up 1.5%, the SP 500 closed 1.7% higher, and the Nasdaq rallied 2.1%.
Here's what our experts – Chris Johnson and Shah Gilani – saw live at the open and close of the trading day.
Chris Johnson (8:45 a.m. EDT)
Chris covered the earnings reports from some of the biggest retailers:Urban Outfitters Inc. (NASDAQ: URBN) missed on revenue as comparable retail segment sales decreased 28%, and the stock was down about 9% on the day. Chris is bearish on the stock.
Lowe's Cos. Inc. (NYSE: LOW) reported EPS of $1.77, which was $0.45 better than consensus analysts estimates. Chris is bullish on the stock, but thought it was slightly overbought this morning. Shares started about 3.5% higher and sold off to close flat for the day.
Target Corp. (NYSE: TGT) reported earnings of $0.59 per share, $0.19 better than analyst estimates. Chris also likes this stock and thought it was overbought heading into earnings. That's likely why shares sold off 3.2% on the day, despite solid earnings.


Overall this is how Chris is thinking about the retail sector:He's bearish on companies that require consumers to browse the selection of goods before buying – think clothing companies, like URBN and AEO.
He's bullish on businesses that consumers go to because they need buy specific things – think home improvement companies, like LOW and HD.



Shah Gilani (3:45 p.m. EDT)
Shah thinks the Nasdaq could easily hit 9,500 by the end of the week.Investors are thinking the worst could be behind us.
But Shah is still concerned about the 36.5 million Americans unemployed and the new number coming in tomorrow – which will likely be in the millions.


After earnings season dies down next week, Shah thinks the market could consolidate and trade sideways until we get serious positive or negative news to push us one way or the other.He doesn't think it's time to go ""all in"" and investors should have tight stops on their positions.

3004869640,Amazon Prime's Newest Movie Release Features One Of 'Normal People's Breakout Stars,"The unusual relationship between two Irish teens is the subject of David Frayne's Dating Amber. In an attempt to halt speculation surrounding their sexuality, the pair join forces to stage what appears to be a young romance. However, sadly for them, things soon begins to unravel. The comedy-drama is set to debut in the UK very soon, and if your interest has been piqued, here's everything you need to know about Dating Amber.

As Screen Daily reports, the film will be available to stream on Amazon Prime Video as of Thursday, June 4, and stars Fionn O’Shea, who many will recognise as Marianne's nasty boyfriend Jamie in the wildly popular Normal People. The actor, who has also starred the four-part ITV drama Innocent, will be playing Eddie in Dating Amber and he is joined by new comer Lola Petticrew as the film's titular character. It appears Petticrew may also have a connection to Normal People, as she has been romantically linked to Paul Mescal, who plays Connell in the BBC adaptation. However, nothing has been confirmed on that front.

Set in the mid '90s, Dating Amber was part-funded by Screen Ireland, who describe the upcoming release as a ""poignant, honest and funny look at the highs and lows of teenage life where the only way to fit in is to not be yourself, even if this goes against your very being.""

Joining O’Shea and Petticrew in the film's cast are Catastrophe's Sharon Horgan, Jimmy's Hall star Barry Ward, Artemis Fowl's Simone Kirby, and more.

The film is also scheduled to be screened at the Cannes virtual market, and commenting on his latest project, writer and director David Freyne revealed that Dating Amber ""is as personal a film"" he will ever make.

""It's my love letter to my home and for all those kids who needed to escape to be themselves,"" he explained. ""At its heart are two extraordinary young stars, Fionn O'Shea and Lola Petticrew. I’m so excited to share it on Amazon Prime Video, to bring some laughter in these uncertain times and for everyone to fall in love with Eddie and Amber.""",en,neutral,0.52575,neutral,0.543554,"['Amazon Prime', 'Breakout', 'Amazon', ""Newest Movie Release Features One Of 'Normal People's Breakout Stars""]","['Amazon Prime Video', 'comedy-drama', 'star', 'Sharon Horgan', 'Mescal', 'BBC', 'Lola', 'Cannes', 'ITV', 'Irish', 'Ireland', 'adaptation.', 'Screen Daily', 'Innocent', 'Artemis Fowl', 'young romance', 'UK', 'Fionn', 'Petticrew', 'Screen Ireland', 'David Frayne', 'Marianne', 'Jamie', 'Eddie', 'Dating Amber', 'Lola Petticrew', 'Normal People', 'Paul Mescal', 'Connell', 'Set', 'Hall', 'Barry Ward', 'Simone Kirby', 'David Freyne', ""Fionn O'Shea"", 'Amazon', 'Catastrophe', 'Jimmy']","['Features', 'Release', 'Normal', 'Movie', 'People', 'Newest', 'Breakout', 'Prime', 'Amazon', 'Stars', 'Amazon Prime', 'young stars', 'Amber', 'film', 'Normal People', 'stars', 'Petticrew', 'David', 'young', 'O’Shea', 'Screen', 'Dating', 'Fionn', 'love', 'Lola', 'Video', 'Amazon Prime Video', 'comedy-drama', 'star', 'Sharon Horgan', 'Mescal', 'BBC', 'Cannes', 'ITV', 'Irish', 'Ireland', 'adaptation.', 'Screen Daily', 'Innocent', 'Artemis Fowl', 'young romance']","['#Ireland', '#AmazonVideo', '#LolaCars', '#AmazonPrime', '#Breakout', '#YoungRomance', '#Comedydrama', '#ScreenInternational', '#ITV', '#ITV', '#Innocent', '#Mezcal', '#BBC', '#BBC', '#Adaptation', '#SharonHorgan', '#Star', '#ArtemisFowl', '#Cannes']",6,14,372,2036,2020-05-20 12:04:22+00:00,The Bustle,"{'avatar_url': None, 'id': 959571, 'name': 'Sam Ramsden'}","{'sentences': ['As Screen Daily reports, the film will be available to stream '

The online grocery shopping for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program was authorized by the U.S. Department of Agriculture for 13 new states, for a total of 36 states and the District of Columbia, which are home to more than 90% of the nation's food stamp users.

New Jersey has 356,000 households with 700,000 of the neediest residents using food stamps.

In New Jersey, SNAP users will be able to use their cards to order from Amazon starting May 27. Online orders with SNAP through Walmart, ShopRite and The Fresh Grocer begin May 28.

The benefits can only be used to purchase eligible groceries and cannot be used to pay for delivery fees.

“Having the option to order groceries online is more important than ever, as we all work together to stay-at-home as much as possible,"" Human Services Commissioner Carole Johnson said Wednesday after federal officials announced approval. ""We hope that the launch of SNAP online grocery shopping promotes equity by providing participants access to a convenient tool that many New Jerseyans are already using to comply with the stay-at-home order.”

Federal officials said they also are expanding the number of authorized retailers who can process SNAP transactions online.

3005012313,"Patent Issued for Suggested Locations For Calendar Events (USPTO 10,643,185): Apple Inc.","2020 MAY 20 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Electronics Business Daily -- According to news reporting originating from Alexandria, Virginia, by NewsRx journalists, a patent by the inventors Adler, Scott (Saratoga, CA); Gross, Daniel C. (San Francisco, CA); Cao, Lili (Sunnyvale, CA); Cates, Samuel C. (Los Gatos, CA); Shin, Hyo Jeong (Santa Clara, CA), filed on September 19, 2016, was published online on May 18, 2020.

The assignee for this patent, patent number 10,643,185, is Apple Inc. (Cupertino, California, United States).

Reporters obtained the following quote from the background information supplied by the inventors: “In general, a calendar is a system of organizing time for social, commercial, administrative, or other purposes. As an example, a calendar can visually represent one or more periods of time (e.g., hours, days, months, or years), and depict one or more events scheduled during those periods of time. This allows users to view events scheduled to occur in the past, present, and/or future, and organize their activities accordingly.

“In many cases, an electronic device (e.g., a computer, mobile or wearable device) can include a calendar application that enables a user to manage a calendar electronically. As an example, a user can add one or more events to an electronic calendar and view or modify the events to manage the user’s schedule.”

In addition to obtaining background information on this patent, NewsRx editors also obtained the inventors’ summary information for this patent: “Systems, methods, devices and non-transitory, computer-readable mediums are disclosed for managing data with respect to an electronic calendar.

“In general, in an aspect, a computer-implemented method includes receiving, at a mobile device, a first calendar item associated with a first event. The first calendar item includes a first text string. The method also includes determining, at the mobile device, a correlation between the first text string and one or more locations associated with one or more second events. The method also includes determining, at the mobile device, a suggested location for the first event based on the correlation.

“Implementations of this aspect can include one or more of the following features.

“In some implementations, the text string can be a title of the calendar item.

“In some implementations, the text string can be a colloquial name of a location.

“In some implementations, the correlation can be determined by receiving, at the mobile device, one or more second calendar items associated with the one or more second events, wherein the second calendar items each comprise the first text string, determining one or more significant locations associated with the second events, and determining the correlation based on the second events and the significant locations.

“In some implementations, the method can further include generating a histogram indicating a frequency in which the first text string is associated with each of the significant locations.

“In some implementations, determining the suggested location can include selecting the suggested location from among the significant locations. The suggested location can be a most frequently occurring significant location with respect to the first text string.

“In some implementations, the method can further include displaying, to a user of the mobile device, the suggested location, receiving, at the mobile device, an instruction from the user to modify the suggested location, and responsive to receiving the instruction to modify the suggested location, displaying, to the user, one or more points of interest near the suggested location. The suggested location can be a geographical region. The one or more points of interest can be within the geographical region.

“In some implementations, the method can further include receiving, from the user, an input from the user selecting one of the one or more points of interest, and responsive to receiving the input selecting one of the one or more points of interest, updating the calendar item to include the selected point of interest.

“In some implementations, the method can further include displaying, to a user of the mobile device, the suggested location, receiving, at the mobile device, an input from the user confirming the suggested location, and responsive to receiving the input confirming the suggested location, adding the suggested location to the first calendar item as a confirmed location for the first event.

“In some implementations, the method can further include receiving, at the mobile device, an instruction from a user to add the first calendar item. The instruction can include entry of at least a portion of the first text string by the user. The method can further include, responsive to receiving the instruction to add the first calendar item, automatically displaying the suggested location for the first event to the user.

“Other implementations are directed to systems, devices and non-transitory, computer-readable mediums.

“Particular implementations provide at least the following advantages. One or more of the implementations described herein can be used to determine suggested locations for the events on an electronic calendar. These suggested locations can be automatically determined by the system, and automatically associated with the events managed by a calendar application, such that the user does not need to manually input a location for each event. In some cases, the system can automatically suggest a location for a calendar event based on a user’s historical behavior with respect to previously scheduled calendar events. Thus, the system can suggest personalized location suggestions for calendar events that more accurately reflect the habits and preferences of the user. Accordingly, the user can enter information regarding calendar events more quickly and efficiently.

“The implementations described herein can also provide various technical benefits. As an example, implementations of the system enable a user to input location information regarding events more quickly and with fewer manual inputs. Thus, the user’s devices can remain in a lower power state for a longer period of time, thereby consuming fewer resources. As a result, the mobile computing device can operate more efficiently.

“As another example, implementations of the system can automatically modify suggested locations for multiple events, without requiring a user to manually modify each individual event location. As above, this enables the user’s devices to remain in a lower power state for a longer period of time, thereby consuming fewer resources. Similarly, the mobile computing device can thus operate more efficiently.

“Details of one or more implementations are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features, aspects, and potential advantages will be apparent from the description and drawings, and from the claims.”

3004997120,Findings on Policy Research Detailed by Investigators at Ton Duc Thang University (Google trends and the predictability of precious metals): Global Views - Policy Research,"2020 MAY 20 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Politics, Law & Government Daily -- Investigators publish new report on Global Views - Policy Research. According to news reporting originating from Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, “In this paper, we examine how Google trends can influence the predictability of the most traded precious metals, namely Gold, Palladium, Platinum and Silver. We construct a predictive model that simultaneously accounts for conditional heteroscedasticity, due to the use of high frequency data; endogeneity bias due to probable exclusion of important predictors and persistence due to the dynamic behaviour of economic agents.”

Our news editors obtained a quote from the research from Ton Duc Thang University, “We also allow for asymmetry in Google trends (G-trends hereafter), to explain positive and negative worded news in the predictability of precious metals. The G-trends series appears to, positively and significantly, impact the returns accruable to the considered precious metals and its inclusion in the predictive model outperforms the random walk model. Also, additional information from other macroeconomic variables, as well as the negative and positive partial sums of G-trends, significantly improve the predictive performance of the single predictor G-trends-based model for precious metals.”

According to the news editors, the research concluded: “On robustness, while we find consistency of model forecast performance both in the in-sample and out-of-sample forecast periods, and across global factors employed, our results seem to be dependent on the choice of precious metal being predicted.”

3005026530,Trevor Noah Unveils A Microsoft Product That May Justify Reopening Buffalo Wild Wings,"There’s two sure-fire ways to piss off Donald Trump, according to Daily Social Distancing Show host Trevor Noah: show him that shirtless photo of Obama, and give people access to mail-in votes.




Noah’s remark reflected President Trump’s tweet threat to withhold federal funding to Nevada and Michigan for taking preliminary steps to move toward mail-in ballots, a process some contend opens up avenues for voting fraud.

Noah contended that “clearly Trump is looking for an excuse” to harass Democratic governors, since some red states are also moving toward mail-in ballots.

Shifting gears, Noah noted that the big news today is that all 50 states are reopening in some fashion for business. Noah said it’s like dating – you start slowly, then go all the way.

	


But he also said that seven states are increasing in coronavirus cases, a condition that could be exacerbated by loose policing of social distancing and other health precautions.

“What is bad is that one state may have been fudging their numbers,” Noah said, pointing a finger at reports out of Georgia, one of the first states to unlock its businesses.

“Take it from me, Georgia. Cheating only hurts you in the long run.” Noah then related how he forged straight A’s on his biology report card. As a result, “I still don’t know where my labia is.”

Coming to the rescue of states that are having trouble reconciling their pandemic numbers is a new Microsoft product that governors can use to “justify your decision to reopen Buffalo Wild Wings.”

3005013564,Founder of Microsoft Healthcare comes up with plan to reduce hidden insurance costs,"With millions of dollars for health plans tied up in hidden fees and negotiations, Microsoft Healthcare founder Dave Chase sought to tamp down on growing healthcare costs.

He started Health Rosetta with the goal of improving transparency among insurance brokers and help employers keep healthcare costs in check. The company claims it can reduce employers’ healthcare costs by 20% to 50%.
 



So far, Health Rosetta has already delivered on that promise for some of its clients. The company said it helped Pacific Steel  Recycling reduce its spending from $8 million to about $3.5 million. It also helped Ohio-based Great Lakes Auto cut its healthcare costs by $1.8 million.

A big part of that is carving out unnecessary fees and conflicts of interest and improving primary care benefits.

“It’s a secret hiding in plain sight if you dig in,” Chase said.

But many companies, with overburdened human resources departments, often don’t.

To start, Chase said, companies can take a closer look at the summary plan document that governs their health plan.

“It’s just riddled with unnecessary fees and conflicts of interest. There are things in that boring stuff that can save you a huge amount of money without affecting the members whatsoever,” he said.

 

Hidden commissions

Another source of hidden cost can stem from undisclosed contracts between brokers and insurance companies. Many self-insured companies turn to brokers to help them design or manage their health plans. But those brokers often receive undisclosed commissions.

According to a report by ProPublica, insurers often pay brokers a commission of 3 to 6 percent of the total premium for employers they enroll. Retention bonuses also serve to keep brokers from shopping around.

“If you maintain 90% of your business with a carrier, you can get a huge bonus,” Chase said. “You have massive conflicts of interest, much of which is undisclosed.”

The solution that Chase proposes is a certification program for health insurance brokers. To participate in the program, they must agree to disclose all of their fees, direct and indirect.  Instead of being paid through insurers, Health Rosetta’s brokers charge their clients a fee, which the company says better aligns them with employers’ interests.

So far, Health Rosetta has trained 170 benefits advisors through the program. Just as LEED certificates became a benchmark for building efficiency, Chase hopes that certifications to improve transparency among insurance brokers will become more commonplace.

 

Better benefits

The other big piece of Health Rosetta’s plan is restructuring primary care to give patients more time and better communication with their doctor rather than fall back on traditional fee-for-service medicine. That involves screening providers for certain quality metrics, such as how many patients required hospitalization, or quality results for common conditions such as hypertension and diabetes.

Members can be incentivized to go to these facilities by waiving out-of-pocket costs.

“The best way to slash health care costs is to improve benefits,” Chase said. “When you see proper primary care, you have fewer surgeries and ER visits, because people take time to talk to people.”

Chase knows it will take time to make substantive differences in the way people pay for healthcare.

“We know this is a 10-20 year journey, easily,” he said.

3004983087,"Patent Issued for Electronic Devices With Voice Command And Contextual Data Processing Capabilities (USPTO 10,643,611): Apple Inc.","2020 MAY 20 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Information Technology Business Daily -- A patent by the inventor Lindahl, Aram M. (Menlo Park, CA), filed on March 28, 2018, was published online on May 18, 2020, according to news reporting originating from Alexandria, Virginia, by NewsRx correspondents.

Patent number 10,643,611 is assigned to Apple Inc. (Cupertino, California, United States).

The following quote was obtained by the news editors from the background information supplied by the inventors: “This invention relates generally to electronic devices, and more particularly, to electronic devices such as portable electronic devices that can capture voice commands and contextual information.

“Electronic devices such as portable electronic devices are becoming increasingly popular. Examples of portable devices include handheld computers, cellular telephones, media players, and hybrid devices that include the functionality of multiple devices of this type. Popular portable electronic devices that are somewhat larger than traditional handheld electronic devices include laptop computers and tablet computers.

“Portable electronic devices such as handheld electronic devices may have limited speech recognition capabilities. For example, a cellular telephone may have a microphone that can be used to receive and process cellular telephone voice commands that control the operation of the cellular telephone.

“Portable electronic devices generally have limited processing power and are not always actively connected to remote databases and services of interest. Conventional devices are often not contextually aware. These shortcomings can make it difficult to use conventional portable electronic devices for sophisticated voice-based control functions.

“It would therefore be desirable to be able to provide improved systems for electronic devices such as portable electronic devices that handle voice-based commands.”

In addition to the background information obtained for this patent, NewsRx journalists also obtained the inventor’s summary information for this patent: “A portable electronic device such as a handheld electronic device is provided. The electronic device may have a microphone that is used to receive voice commands. The electronic device may use the microphone to record a user’s voice. The recording of the user’s voice may be stored as a digital audio file in storage associated with the electronic device.

“When the electronic device receives a voice command, the electronic device may store information about the current state of the electron device and its operating environment as contextual information (metadata). With one suitable arrangement, stored contextual information may include information about the operational state of the electronic device such as which applications are running on the device and their status. The electronic device may determine which portions of the information on the state of the device are relevant to the voice command and may store only the relevant portions. If desired, the electronic device may determine which contextual information is most relevant by performing a speech recognition operation on the recorded voice command to look for specific keywords.

“The electronic device may process voice commands locally or voice commands processing may be performed remotely. For example, the electronic device may transmit one or more recorded voice commands and associated contextual information to computing equipment such as a desktop computer. Captured voice commands and contextual information may also be uploaded to server computing equipment over a network. The electronic device may transmit recorded voice commands and the associated contextual information at any suitable time such as when instructed by a user, as each voice command is received, immediately after each voice command is received, whenever the electronic device is synched with appropriate computing equipment, or other suitable times.

“After a recorded voice command and associated contextual information have been transferred to a desktop computer, remote server, or other computing equipment, the computing equipment may process the voice command using a speech recognition operation. The computing equipment may use the results of the speech recognition operation and any relevant contextual information together to respond to the voice command properly. For example, the computing equipment may respond to the voice command by displaying search results or performing other suitable actions). If desired, the computing equipment may convey information back to the electronic device in response to the voice command.

“In a typical scenario, a user may make a voice command while directing the electronic device to record the voice command. The user may make the voice command while the electronic device is performing a particular operation with an application. For example, the user may be using the electronic device to play songs with a media application. While listening to a song, the user may press a record button on the electronic device to record the voice command ‘find more like this.’ The voice command may be processed by the electronic device (e.g., to create a code representative of the spoken command) or may be stored in the form of an audio clip by the electronic device. At an appropriate time, such as when the electronic device is connected to a host computer or a remote server through a communications path, the code or the audio clip corresponding to the spoken command may be uploaded for further processing. Contextual information such as information on the song that was playing in the media application when the voice command was made may be uploaded with the voice command.

“A media playback application on a computer such as the iTunes program of Apple Inc. may take an appropriate action in response to uploaded voice command and associated contextual data. As an example, the media playback application may present a user with recommended songs for purchase. The songs that are recommended may be songs that are similar to the song that was playing on the electronic device when the user captured the audio clip voice command ‘find more like this.’

“The computer to which the voice command audio clip is uploaded may have greater processing power available than that available on a handheld electronic device, so voice processing accuracy may be improved by offloading voice recognition operations to the computer from the handheld electronic device in this way. The computer to which the audio clip is uploaded may also have access to more extensive data that would be available on a handheld electronic device such as the contents of a user’s full home media library. The computer that receives the uploaded command may also have access to online resources such as an online server database. This database may have been difficult or impossible for the user to access from the handheld device when the voice command was captured.

“If desired, the contextual information that is captured by the electronic device in association with a captured voice command may include audio information. For example, a user may record a spoken phrase. Part of the spoken phrase may represent a voice command and part of the spoken phrase may include associated contextual information. As an example, a user may be using a mapping application on a handheld electronic device. The device may be presenting the user with a map that indicates the user’s current position. The user may press a button or may otherwise instruct the handheld electronic device to record the phrase ‘I like American restaurants in this neighborhood.’ In response, the electronic device may record the spoken phrase. The recorded phrase (in this example), includes a command portion (‘I like’) that instructs the mapping application to create a bookmark or other indicator of the user’s preference. The recorded phrase also includes the modifier ‘American restaurants’ to provide partial context for the voice command. Additional contextual information (i.e., the phrase ‘in this neighborhood) and accompanying position data (e.g., geographic coordinates from global positioning system circuitry in the device) may also be supplied in conjunction with the recorded voice command. When uploaded, the audio clip voice command and the associated audio clip contextual information can be processed by speech recognition software and appropriate actions taken.

“Further features of the invention, its nature and various advantages will be more apparent from the accompanying drawings and the following detailed description of the preferred embodiments.”

The claims supplied by the inventors are:

“What is claimed is:

“1. A method for processing voice commands, comprising: at an electronic device with one or more processors and memory: receiving a user utterance representing a user request; determining, based on one or more words in the user utterance, contextual information of the electronic device that is associated with the user request; based on the user utterance and the contextual information, causing determination of one or more actions responsive to the user request; causing performance of the one or more actions to generate a result; and presenting the result.

3004962105,"Google Cloud BrandVoice: How The World Became Data-Driven, And What’s Next","A look at the evolution of the data landscape, how technology is helping businesses solve for now, and how the data analysis that’s possible today can provide us with a new understanding of how we, as a society, can perform better in the future.

Perhaps the most dramatic outcome of the digital revolution is the amount of data that’s now collected and analyzed. IDC calculates that in 2010 the world created about two zettabytes (ZB) of digital information. If that were put into 1 GB thumb drives that were then laid end to end, it would make a line that could stretch across 184 million football fields. That sounds impressive, until you consider that the World Economic Forum figures there will be 44 ZB collected in 2020.

This growth in data produced and collected is profound—and as COVID-19 has caused disruption to economies, businesses, and lives around the world, it has become more urgent to not only marvel at the scale of all this data but also to understand how it’s being put to work. 

Evolution of the data landscape

There has never in human history been such an information explosion. You could attribute this to the rise of smartphones, sensors, and connected vehicles and appliances, among other digital artifacts. Much of what we touch and work with now automatically generates data. But the real reason why we’re seeing this increase is the growing utility of data analytics and automated responses to analytic decisions.

The past decade’s data explosion created a virtuous circle of data analysis and action, leading to new insights, data creation, and data analysis. We’ve seen companies collect more data than ever before as they’ve raced to transform their businesses and make data-driven decisions. 


 To stay viable and thrive in this rapidly changing environment, businesses need to be good at anticipating what’s next and reacting in real time. 


This has spurred all kinds of personalized, connected objects, such as industrial machinery that saves money by signaling when it needs maintenance. And it's spurred services that combine digital information from traffic information, and social network graphing. It's also brought greater efficiency to things like supply chains and consumer marketing, to name just a couple of examples.

This explosion also pushed other organizations to re-evaluate their strategies and look to cloud infrastructure to provide relief from legacy tools that could not keep up with the growing needs of the business.

Solving for now

There have been pandemics in human history. This is the first where people have had access to online digital technologies that enable things like working, schooling, seeing the doctor, grocery shopping, and even attending digital conferences from home—all necessary activities for suppressing the rate of infection. Some of these changes may be permanent, leading to structural changes in the society and the economy. Consequently, data growth and analytics-driven decision-making are likely to continue proliferating. 

To stay viable and thrive in this rapidly changing environment, businesses need to be good at anticipating what’s next and reacting in real time. For example, with changing consumer demand patterns, retailers need to make their inventory management, supply chain infrastructure, delivery mechanisms, and customer experiences much more data-driven and dynamic. 

Not surprisingly, we've seen for ourselves that they are leaning heavily on real-time and predictive analytics to do just that—it’s vital for their survival and success. Increasingly, they are also exploring the use of new industrial innovations like virtual showrooms, robotic manufacturing, and driverless delivery fleets in a post-COVID-19 digital economy. Adoption of these new technologies will create even more data and will further accelerate the use of sophisticated analytics.

In my role at Google Cloud, I’ve grown a profound appreciation for the core values of speed, scale, access, and flexibility that are at the heart of good data analytics technologies—in products like BigQuery and several more across the industry. The engineers behind these innovations anticipated and fostered a world with more data than most people could have dreamed of a decade ago. 

Over the past few months, we’ve seen our technology rise up to the occasion to support businesses across all industries, along with researchers and government institutions who are using our technology in many incredible ways. 

Through our global analytics platform, we’ve made a hosted repository of public datasets like the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CSSE) dataset, the Global Health Data from the World Bank, and OpenStreetMap data free to access and query through our COVID-19 Public Dataset Program. These datasets remove barriers and provide access to critical information quickly, safely, and easily, eliminating the need to search for and onboard large data files.

Northeastern University is one such organization that has been able to leverage our data analytics tools during this time. According to Dr. Matteo Chinazzi, Associate Research Scientist at Northeastern University, “Our team models and forecasts the spatial spread of infectious diseases by quickly analyzing hundreds of terabytes of simulation data. With the help of BigQuery, we are able to accelerate insights from our epidemic models and better study evolution of an ongoing outbreak.”

Looking to the future

The data analysis that’s possible today can provide us with a new understanding of how to stay safe and how we, as a society, can perform better in the future. As all of us struggle with rapid changes, the ability to perform cheap, fast, and flexible analysis of the newest and most reliable information becomes even more critical to the way we work. 

Serverless and no-ops cloud deployments will continue to automate many kinds of computing infrastructure, allowing customers to focus on running their businesses instead of managing infrastructure. As businesses require more and more real-time decision-making, streaming data becomes paramount to making real-time business decisions. With the continued democratization of machine learning, which can now be accessed with as little as a cloud API or a pretrained model, data analysts can quickly operationalize technology-driven initiatives that would have been prohibitively costly or time-consuming to develop just a few years ago. Additionally, scalable, flexible pricing and service options help more businesses analyze and react to a fast-changing world. 

This is truer nowhere than in the healthcare industry. Doctors and nurses have been at the forefront of this pandemic, and being able to support companies that support healthcare workers is truly an honor. Wellframe, a digital health management platform, is one customer who has been using our analytics platform to support healthcare organizations. 


 Wellframe has already seen an 80% increase in weekly patient plan engagement, driving care improvements for providers, health plans, and clinicians. 


According to Mohammad Jouni, CTO of Wellframe, with BigQuery, Wellframe has helped many health plans’ care management teams dramatically improve the medical experience for patients with long-term conditions. Wellframe and BigQuery together enable faster analysis and resolution of patient needs, improved clinician performance, and better predictive health outcomes. For example, Wellframe has already seen an 80% increase in weekly patient plan engagement, driving care improvements for providers, health plans, and clinicians.

A pandemic reminds us what is truly important, and what values we want to live and work by. The importance of those values is reflected in the way they’ve shaped the businesses built on them. Values such as accurate insight and rapid adjustment empower us as people to respond to new challenges with ever more data—delivered faster, from more sources, and for new purposes. The ingenuity of those people inspires us to add new features and capabilities to our analytics platform. Ten years into its success, Google Cloud’s petabyte-scale data warehouse continues to help customers cost-effectively run analytics at scale, with agility and efficiency.

This month, Google’s cloud data warehouse BigQuery turns 10. We got together to reflect on some of the technical milestones, memorable moments along the way, and think about what’s next for data analytics.

3005012185,"Researchers Submit Patent Application, “Wireless Charging Control Based On Electronic Device Events”, for Approval (USPTO 20200136403): Apple Inc.","2020 MAY 20 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Electronics Business Daily -- From Washington, D.C., NewsRx journalists report that a patent application by the inventors Zadesky, Stephen P. (Portola Valley, CA); Dai, Hongli (Los Altos, CA), filed on December 27, 2019, was made available online on April 30, 2020.

The patent’s assignee is Apple Inc. (Cupertino, California, United States).

News editors obtained the following quote from the background information supplied by the inventors: “Current electronic devices continue to become more prevalent in day-to-day activities. For example, smart phones and tablet computers continue to grow in popularity and provide everyday personal and business functions to its users. These electronic devices are usually operational for the majority of a typical day, where a user may utilize the electronic device to send messages (e.g., text and e-mail), work on documents, play games, conduct phone calls, and perform other personal and/or business specific tasks.

“With extensive daily use, a long battery life is one of the most important operational characteristics of the electronic device. However, as the overall size of the electronic device continues to get smaller, the internal space of the electronic device also gets smaller. This reduced internal space may result in a smaller battery as well. With a smaller battery in an electronic device, the battery may need to be charged daily--or even several times a day.

“The charging of the electronic device typically includes electrically coupling the electronic device to a charging device. The charging device may provide an electrical current to the electronic device, and the electronic device may convert the current to charge the battery. Conventional charging devices for the electronic device may charge a depleted battery to a threshold charge value (e.g., 100%). Once the battery reaches the threshold charge value, the conventional charging device may stop providing an electrical current to the electronic device, which may ultimately allow the maximum charged battery to deplete. When the battery depletes to a predetermined minimum charge value (e.g., 90%), the charging device may once again provide electrical current to the electronic device to charge the battery to the threshold charge value again. When an electronic device remains connected to the conventional charging device, the cycle between threshold charge value and predetermined minimum charge value may occur several times.

“With each charge to the threshold charge value and/or each cycle between the threshold charge value and the predetermined minimum charge value, the life of certain types of batteries may be reduced. More specifically, each time such batteries cycle between the threshold charge value and predetermined minimum charge value during the conventional charging process, the battery’s ability to hold a maximum charge for a duration of time may be substantially reduced. Over time the reduction in the battery’s ability to hold the charge may result in the battery needing to be charged several times a day. When the battery cannot be charged several times a day, the battery may be completely depleted and the electronic device may be inoperable (e.g., shutdown due to lack of power).”

As a supplement to the background information on this patent application, NewsRx correspondents also obtained the inventors’ summary information for this patent application: “Generally, embodiments discussed herein are related to an electronic device, a charging device and a method for charging the battery of the electronic device. The electronic device may include a battery and a charging system for charging the battery. The charging system may be configured to monitor the activities and/or events of the electronic device to ensure that the battery is substantially charged prior to, or immediately after the occurrence of an event. That is, the charging of the battery may be dependent upon the monitoring and/or the occurrence of activities and events of the electronic device, and not cycling between threshold charge values and minimum charge values. As a result, the charging system of the electronic device may substantially prevent undesirable depletion of the battery’s ability to maintain a charge. That is, by eliminating the cycling charging of the battery of the electronic device, the charging system of the electronic device may minimize and substantially prevent the depletion of the battery’s ability to maintain a charge.

“One embodiment may include an electronic device. The electronic device may include a battery and a charging system in electronic communication with the battery. The charging system may be configured to charge at least a partially-depleted battery to a threshold charge value, discontinue the charging in response to the battery being charged to the threshold charge value, and monitor the function of the electronic device to detect at least one of an anticipated event and an unanticipated event of the electronic device. Additionally, the charging system may be configured to recharge the battery in response to detecting one of the anticipated event occurring subsequent to the recharging of the battery or the unanticipated event occurring immediately before the recharging of the battery.

“Another embodiment may include a charging device for an electronic device. The charging device may include a connection portion electrically coupled to a battery of the electronic device, and a charging system in electronic communication with the battery of the electronic device. The charging system may be configured to charge at least a partially-depleted battery to a threshold charge value, discontinue the charging in response to the battery being charged to the threshold charge value, and monitor the function of the electronic device to detect at least one of an anticipated event and an unanticipated event of the electronic device. Additionally, the charging system may be configured to recharge the battery in response to detecting one of the anticipated event occurring subsequent to the recharging of the battery or the unanticipated event occurring immediately before the recharging of the battery.

“A further embodiment may include a method for charging a battery of an electronic device. The method may include charging at least a partially-depleted battery for the electronic device to a threshold charge value, discontinuing the charging in response to the battery being charged to the threshold charge value, and monitoring the function of the electronic device to detect at least one of an anticipated event and an unanticipated event of the electronic device. The method may also include recharging the battery in response to detecting one of the anticipated event occurring subsequent to the reactivation of the charging device or the unanticipated event occurring immediately before the reactivation of the charging device.”

The claims supplied by the inventors are:

“1-19. (canceled)

3004983285,Patent Application Titled “Media Message Creation With Automatic Titling” Published Online (USPTO 20200137349): Apple Inc.,"2020 MAY 20 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Information Technology Business Daily -- According to news reporting originating from Washington, D.C., by NewsRx journalists, a patent application by the inventors Black, David (San Jose, CA); Harding, Andrew L. (Portola Valley, CA); Weil, Joseph-Alexander P. (Greenbrae, CA); Brasure, James (Belmont, CA); Berkeley, Joash S. (Savannah, GA); Ernst, Katherine K. (Cedar Rapids, IA); Salvador, Richard (Culver City, CA); Sheeler, Stephen (Santa Monica, CA); Cummings, William D. (San Mateo, CA); Wang, Xiaohuan Corina (Los Altos, CA); Clark, Robert L. (Cupertino, CA); O’Neil, Kevin M. (Cupertino, CA), filed on December 26, 2019, was made available online on April 30, 2020.

The assignee for this patent application is Apple Inc. (Cupertino, California, United States).

Reporters obtained the following quote from the background information supplied by the inventors: “With the advent of social media and the advancements in electronic messaging and network capabilities, video messaging is becoming more and more commonplace. Since many users turn off or turn down the sound when viewing video, users may wish to add titles, captioning, or other text to their video messages that describe the context of the video message or provide an opinion or comment on the video presented in the video message. However, manually adding captions, titles, and/or text to a video message can be burdensome and time consuming.”

In addition to obtaining background information on this patent application, NewsRx editors also obtained the inventors’ summary information for this patent application: “In some implementations, a user device can be configured to create media messages with automatic titling. For example, a user can create a media messaging project that includes multiple video clips. The video clips can be generated based on video data and/or audio data captured by the user device and/or based on pre-recorded video data and/or audio data obtained from various storage locations. When the user device captures the audio data for a clip, the user device can obtain a speech-to-text transcription of the audio data in near real time and present the transcription data (e.g., text) overlaid on the video data while the video data is being captured and/or presented by the user device. Thus, a user can quickly generate a media message without having to manually generate the desired text.

“Particular implementations provide at least the following advantages: A user can quickly generate a media message (e.g., media compilation, media sequence, media project, etc.) that includes media from multiple sources. The user can quickly add commentary or other audio to a video clip. The user device can automatically convert (e.g., transcribe) the audio speech into text that is overlaid on the presented video clip. Moreover, the transcription text can be synchronized with the video and/or audio of the video clip so that the words of the transcribed text are presented at the same rate (e.g., cadence) at which they were originally spoken in the audio recording and/or video recording. Thus, the user is saved the time and effort of manually generating captions, titling, or other text for presentation with the video clip and/or media message.

“Details of one or more implementations are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features, aspects, and potential advantages will be apparent from the description and drawings, and from the claims.”

3005030949,A world redrawn: Legendary photographer captures the way that coronavirus creating a ‘genocide’ threat in the Amazon,"Legendary photographer Sebastiao Salgado has warned of a “genocide” of the Amazon’s indigenous peoples if the Brazilian government does not do more to protect them from the coronavirus.

The country’s far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro — who has dismissed the virus as a “little flu” — has long been accused of encouraging loggers and farmers to invade indigenous reserves and of dismantling government agencies set up to protect them.

Brazilian-born Salgado, who shot to fame with his almost biblical images of gold miners in the Amazon, told AFP that “there was a huge risk of a real catastrophe”.

“With gold miners, loggers, farmers and religious sects invading their territories… there is a big risk of the coronavirus infecting the indigenous people, who don’t have any antibodies.”

According to some estimates, 90 percent of the native population of the Americas was wiped out by disease after the arrival of the first Europeans.

Salgado has launched a petition calling for action to protect the Amazonian peoples which has garnered almost a quarter of a million signatures, including Madonna, Oprah Winfrey and Brad Pitt.

He said the risk of genocide was not an exaggeration.

“That is what I call it. Genocide is the elimination of an ethnic group and also of its culture.

“I believe that is where the Bolsonaro government is leading us, because their position is 100 percent against the indigenous people.”

With hospitals in Sao Paulo, Brazil’s biggest city, reported to be at “near collapse” as the country has become the epicentre of the pandemic in South America, Salgado warned that the threat of death was hanging “over a large portion of the population”.

“Bolsonaro is against a lockdown, and they do not have the medical infrastructure that we have” in Europe, said Salgado, 76, who has long lived in Paris.

“If the virus gets into the forest, they don’t have the means to help. The distances are so huge. The indigenous people will be abandoned,” the photographer said.

The virus has already infected 40 indigenous groups, with 537 positive cases and 102 deaths, according to the Brazilian Indigenous Peoples’ Association.

And on Tuesday, the indigenous rights group, Forest Guardians, warned that one tribe of hunter gatherers, the Awa Guaja, which traditionally has no contact with the outside world, was in danger of being wiped out because of encroachment by loggers and farmers.

Brazil has an estimated 800,000 indigenous people from 300 ethnic groups.

“If you don’t put an end to the invasions of our territory, the uncontacted Awa Guaja people will die,” said the Forest Guardians, several of whose members have been murdered in recent months.

Salgado said that the coronavirus was “also a product of our destruction of the environment and the planet”.

Yet, he added, it had given us a chance to rethink everything.

“We have become the aliens” living in towns and cities, he said.

“We destroy everything so we can feed it into the cities and keep them going.”

He said that humanity needed to have a long hard look at how it was living, and change course.

“We will have so much to do” after the virus, he said.

“We have to create a new and properly productive system… If we go in that direction, we will have to guarantee that a large part of the riches of the planet go towards its reconstruction.”",en,positive,0.770254,positive,0.7202109999999999,"['genocide', 'Amazon', 'photographer', 'Legendary']","['Brazil', 'hunter gatherers', 'ethnic group', 'Amazon', 'antibodies', 'gold', 'Europe', 'Amazonian', 'far-right', 'Paris', 'epicentre', 'Madonna', 'Brad Pitt', 'photographer', 'South America', 'lockdown', 'virus', 'uncontacted', 'genocide', 'pandemic', 'forest', 'indigenous peoples', 'indigenous people', '300 ethnic groups', 'Sebastiao Salgado', 'coronavirus', 'Oprah Winfrey', 'indigenous rights', 'Sao Paulo, Brazil', 'Legendary', 'Americas', 'Sao Paulo', 'Jair Bolsonaro', 'Bolsonaro', 'Awa Guaja', 'Salgado', 'AFP', 'Brazilian Indigenous Peoples’ Association', 'Forest Guardians']","['coronavirus', 'photographer', 'genocide', 'Legendary', 'threat', 'Amazon', 'redrawn', 'indigenous people', 'indigenous peoples', 'indigenous groups', 'Salgado', 'Bolsonaro government', 'peoples', 'indigenous', 'virus', 'Bolsonaro', 'group', 'risk', 'government', 'forest', 'large', 'loggers', 'Brazil', 'hunter gatherers', 'ethnic group', 'antibodies', 'gold', 'Europe', 'Amazonian', 'far-right', 'Paris', 'epicentre', 'Madonna', 'Brad Pitt', 'South America', 'lockdown', 'uncontacted', 'pandemic', '300 ethnic groups', 'Sebastiao Salgado', 'Oprah Winfrey', 'indigenous rights', 'planet', 'Sao Paulo, Brazil']","['#IndigenousPeoples', '#Coronavirus', '#Photographer', '#Genocide', '#Amazon', '#Virus', '#Gold', '#Planet', '#SebastiãoSalgado', '#FarrightPolitics', '#Antibody', '#AmazonBasin', '#Madonna', '#OprahWinfrey', '#BradPitt', '#EthnicGroup', '#SãoPaulo', '#Epicenter', '#Pandemic', '#SouthAmerica', '#Lockdown', '#Europe', '#Paris', '#Forest', '#IndigenousRights', '#Huntergatherer', '#Brazil', '#EthnicGroupsInIndonesia', '#UncontactedPeoples']",23,26,576,3343,2020-05-21 03:28:58+00:00,Raw Story,"{'avatar_url': None, 'id': 943329, 'name': 'Agence France-presse'}","{'sentences': ['Legendary photographer Sebastiao Salgado has warned of a '

6:48 pm ET — YouTube advertisers in April mostly ran non-Covid related ads on the platform, an executive said. ""80% of the ads that we saw in April were not Covid-related; they were straight-up ads,"" said Tara Walpert Levy, VP of agency and media solutions at Google and YouTube. She said generally, Covid-themed ads did not perform any better than regular ads on the site. The company looked at factors like what people watched and how they engaged, as well as brand metrics like consideration or brand preference. Surprisingly, YouTube found that Covid-specific ads performed no better or worse than regular ads. —Megan Graham

2:38 pm ET — After President Donald Trump pressured the Food and Drug Administration to waive certain rules, his administration was able to purchase mask-cleaning machines in a deal that ballooned from a $60 million price tag to one with a ceiling of $600 million. Not only did the deal costs explode, but the cleaning process used by the machines to sanitize the masks may actually damage them and prevent them from being reused.The machines were supposed to allow masks to be reused up to 20 times through sanitizing treatments. However, scientists and nurses say that masks cleaned by the machines began to degrade after two or three treatments, putting them at risk. ""They keep saying these recycled masks are still safe after all these cycles, but we don't know that,"" said a nurse in Pennsylvania, whose hospital has used the machines. ""What we do know is that there are not enough masks for medical workers and there are very real consequences if we get sick."" —Hannah Miller

3004989231,“Target Wake Time Traffic Differentiation And Service Period Extension” in Patent Application Approval Process (USPTO 20200137612): Apple Inc.,"2020 MAY 20 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Network Business Daily -- A patent application by the inventors Li, Guoqing (Campbell, CA); Yu, Yang (Cupertino, CA); Kasten, Welly (Cupertino, CA); Rana, Shehla S. (Cupertino, CA); Fikirlier, Mete (Cupertino, CA); Mekala, Karthik R. (Cupertino, CA); Dominguez, Charles F. (Redwood City, CA); Liu, Yong (Cupertino, CA); Kumar, Rajneesh (San Jose, CA), filed on August 29, 2019, was made available online on April 30, 2020, according to news reporting originating from Washington, D.C., by NewsRx correspondents.

This patent application is assigned to Apple Inc. (Cupertino, California, United States).

The following quote was obtained by the news editors from the background information supplied by the inventors: “Field

“The described embodiments generally relate to channel access in wireless communications.

“Related Art

“Target wake time (TWT) is a power saving mechanism that can be used with communication techniques compatible with institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 802.11 standards (such as, but not limited to IEEE 802.11ax). For example, the TWT scheme (or technique) can be used within a wireless local area Network (WLAN). In this example, an access point (AP) and one or more stations (STAs) can negotiate a specific time or a set of times for the stations to access a medium. The TWT scheme can be used to control the amount of contention over the medium by allowing the station to set up a periodic active/sleep (power save) schedule with the access point. Using the TWT scheme, the station does not need to send explicit power save and active transition notifications to the access point, which was traditionally done through, for example, setting a power management (PM) indication bit in a media access control (MAC) header of a MAC frame. In a congested environment, the successful transmission of PM indication bit may take long time, and thus the use of the TWT scheme allows the station to transition between an active mode and a sleep mode in a responsive manner, improving power consumption and latency.”

3005011954,"Patent Issued for Display With Adjustable Direct-Lit Backlight Units (USPTO 10,643,549): Apple Inc.","2020 MAY 20 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Electronics Business Daily -- Apple Inc. (Cupertino, California, United States) has been issued patent number 10,643,549, according to news reporting originating out of Alexandria, Virginia, by NewsRx editors.

The patent’s inventors are Jung, Tobias (San Francisco, CA); Albrecht, Marc (San Francisco, CA); Petrovich, Duane M. (San Francisco, CA); Chang, Sean C. (Mountain View, CA); Zalatimo, David S. (San Jose, CA); Emelie, Pierre-Yves (Mountian View, CA); Luthra, Manev (Cupertino, CA); Le, Chengrui (San Jose, CA); Hong, Lingyu (Princeton Jct, NJ); Yao, Wei H. (Palo Alto, CA).

This patent was filed on November 5, 2019 and was published online on May 18, 2020.

From the background information supplied by the inventors, news correspondents obtained the following quote: “This relates generally to displays, and, more particularly, to backlit displays.

“Electronic devices often include displays. For example, computers and cellular telephones are sometimes provided with backlit liquid crystal displays. Edge-lit backlight units have light-emitting diodes that emit light into an edge surface of a light guide plate. The light guide plate then distributes the emitted light laterally across the display to serve as backlight illumination. Direct-lit backlight units have arrays of light-emitting diodes that emit light vertically through the display.

“Direct-lit backlights may have locally dimmable light-emitting diodes that allow dynamic range to be enhanced and power consumption to be reduced. If care is not taken, however, a direct-lit backlight may be bulky or may produce undesired visible artifacts.”

Supplementing the background information on this patent, NewsRx reporters also obtained the inventors’ summary information for this patent: “A display may have a pixel array such as a liquid crystal pixel array. The pixel array may be illuminated with backlight illumination from a backlight unit. The backlight unit may include an array of light-emitting diodes, with each light-emitting diode being placed in a respective cell. The brightness of each light-emitting diode may be changed in each display frame to optimize the viewing of the display.

“A backlight brightness selection circuit may select brightness values for the light-emitting diodes in the backlight unit. The backlight brightness selection circuit may select the brightness values based on image data. The backlight brightness selection circuit may select the brightness values based on brightness values used by the light-emitting diodes in previous image frames. The backlight brightness selection circuit may select the brightness values based on device information such as information regarding which software applications are currently operating on the electronic device. The backlight brightness selection circuit may select the brightness values based on display information such as a display operating mode. The backlight brightness selection circuit may select the brightness values based on environmental conditions such as the ambient light level or temperature.

“The backlight brightness selection circuit may use a content analysis circuit that generates target brightness values based on image content. A flicker mitigation circuit may modify the target brightness values to reduce visible flickering during operation of the display. The flicker mitigation circuit may use a temporal filter to reduce flickering, for example. A halo mitigation circuit may modify the target brightness values to reduce visible halo in the displayed image. The halo mitigation circuit may prioritize between mitigating visible halo and preserving dynamic range in the image based on the content of the image and other received information.

“A flash mitigation circuit in the backlight brightness selection circuit may identify when there is a risk of a detectable flash occurring and may take suitable mitigating action when a flash risk is detected. A scene change detection circuit may identify when a scene change has occurred by comparing the brightness values of one or more previous frames to target brightness values of the current frame. If a scene change is detected, suitable action may be taken (e.g., the parameters of the flicker mitigation circuit may be modified).

“The backlight levels selected by the backlight brightness selection may be modified by a power consumption compensation circuit. The power consumption compensation circuit may receive the target backlight levels from the backlight brightness selection circuit and may estimate the amount of power consumption required to operate the backlight using the target brightness levels. The power consumption compensation circuit may estimate the amount of power consumption using one or more look-up tables. The power consumption compensation circuit may assess both static power consumption (associated with a single display frame) and dynamic power consumption (associated with a sequence of display frames).”

3005012038,"Patent Issued for Ceramic-Based Components Having Laser-Etched Markings (USPTO 10,639,746): Apple Inc.","2020 MAY 20 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Electronics Business Daily -- A patent by the inventors Nashner, Michael S. (Cupertino, CA); Russell-Clarke, Peter N. (Cupertino, CA), filed on February 24, 2015, was published online on May 18, 2020, according to news reporting originating from Alexandria, Virginia, by NewsRx correspondents.

Patent number 10,639,746 is assigned to Apple Inc. (Cupertino, California, United States).

The following quote was obtained by the news editors from the background information supplied by the inventors: “Conventional electronic devices typically include housings made from durable materials to protect the electronic device. It is desired to form these housings from materials that may withstand the everyday wear-and-tear applied to the electronic device. That is, the housing may be formed from a material that may withstand constant handling of the electronic device by a user, the transportation and/or packing of the electronic devices and undesired blunt forces (e.g., dropping, sitting on) applied to the electronic device during use. In conventional electronic devices, the housing may be formed from metals (e.g., aluminum), reinforced glass, and/or polymers (e.g., plastic, rubber).

“Ceramic-based materials are typically not used to form housings for electronic devices. As a result of the physical and/or chemical properties of ceramic-based materials, certain manufacturing processes used to form an electronic device housing may be difficult and/or expensive to perform on ceramic-based material. For example, housings for electronic devices typically include designs, text or logos formed right on or in the material forming the housing. The designs, text or logos may be painted directly on a surface of the housing, or an etch may first be made on the surface, and then the etch may be subsequently painted.

“When painting the designs on a ceramic-based material, the finished painted component needs to be ‘fired’ or heated, to set the paint into the material. The process of heating the entire component formed from the ceramic-based material may substantially alter and/or undesirably change the physical and/or chemical properties of the ceramic-based material. In addition, the process of painting a design on a surface of a component formed from any material, ceramic-based or not, may require additional processing, such as, the application of a protective coating to avoid chipping or wearing away of the paint. The application of the protective coating over the painted surface may increase manufacturing time and/or cost of producing an electronic device housing.

“With respect to etching ceramic-based material, conventional etching processes performed on the surface of ceramic-based material may be difficult and/or expensive to complete, because of the physical and/or chemical properties of the ceramic-based material. More specifically, due to the hardness, elasticity, fracture toughness and/or ductility of ceramic-based materials, conventional etching processes may produce insufficient or undesirable results when forming the designs on the surface of the ceramic-based materials. For example, the etch formed in the ceramic-based material using conventional etching processes may be substantially minimal or negligible, such that the etch may not be deep enough in the surface to be adequately painted. Where the etch is not capable of being painted due to the inadequate depth of the etch, the paint applied to the surface etch, protected by a protective coating or not, may wear off or fade over the life of the electronic device.”

In addition to the background information obtained for this patent, NewsRx journalists also obtained the inventors’ summary information for this patent: “Generally, embodiments discussed herein are related to a ceramic-based component including laser-etched markings, an electronic device including a ceramic-based component, and methods of forming the ceramic-based component including laser-etched markings. Ceramic-based components for an electronic device may include a laser-etched marking formed on an outer surface of the ceramic-based component. The process of laser etching the marking on the outer surface of the ceramic-based component may result in the formation of a recess in the ceramic-based component and, a contrast in colors between the outer surface and the laser-etched marking or recess. More specifically, the process of ablating and melting a portion of the ceramic-based component during a laser etching process may result in a color contrast, or other optical contrast, between the laser-etched portion (e.g., marking or recess) and the unaffected, outer surface of the ceramic-based component. The color/optical contrast may be formed as a result of the way light interacts with and/or reflects from the outer surface of the ceramic-based component, in contrast to the uneven, laser-etched marking or recess formed in the ceramic-based component. By forming a color contrast between the outer surface and the marking or recess formed on the surface of the ceramic-based component, the need for painting a design, text or logo on the component may be unnecessary. As such, the manufacturing time and/or cost of forming a ceramic-based component for an electronic device may be reduced. Furthermore, the marking formed on the surface of the ceramic-based component may be substantially permanent, and may not wear off, distort and/or fade over the life of the electronic device.

“One embodiment may include a ceramic-based component. The ceramic-based component may include an outer surface, and a laser-etched marking formed on the outer surface. The laser-etched marking may comprise a recess having a substantially uneven surface formed in the outer surface. The recess may include a material composition distinct from a material composition of the outer surface.

“Another embodiment may include an electronic device. The electronic device may include a housing having at least one outer surface. The electronic device may also include a laser-etched marking formed in the outer surface of the housing. The marking may comprise a material composition distinct from a material composition of the outer surface. Additionally, the electronic device may include a heat affected region positioned adjacent to the laser-etched marking. The heat affected region may be positioned below the outer surface of the housing.

“A further embodiment may include a method of forming a ceramic-based component. The method may include laser etching an outer surface of a ceramic-based component, and in response to the laser etching, forming a laser-etched marking on the outer surface of the ceramic-based component. The method may also include altering the optically reflective properties of the laser-etched marking and/or altering a material composition of the laser-etched marking relative to a distinct material composition of the outer surface of the ceramic-based component.”

3004974270,Researchers at First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University Detail Findings in COVID-19 (More effective strategies are required to strengthen public awareness of COVID-19: Evidence from Google Trends): Coronavirus - COVID-19,"2020 MAY 20 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at CDC & FDA Daily -- Research findings on Coronavirus - COVID-19 are discussed in a new report. According to news originating from Anhui, People’s Republic of China, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, “The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has posed stress on the health and well-being of both Chinese people and the public worldwide. Global public interest in this new issue largely reflects people’s attention to COVID-19 and their willingness to take precautionary actions.”

Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from the First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University, “This study aimed to examine global public awareness of COVID-19 using Google Trends. Using Google Trends, we retrieved public query data for terms of ‘2019-nCoV + SARS-CoV-2 + novel coronavirus + new coronavirus + COVID-19 + Corona Virus Disease 2019’ between the 31 December 2019 and the 24 February 2020 in six major English-speaking countries, including the USA, the UK, Canada, Ireland, Australia, and New Zealand. Dynamic series analysis demonstrates the overall change trend of relative search volume (RSV) for the topic on COVID-19. We compared the top-ranking related queries and sub-regions distribution of RSV about COVID-19 across different countries. The correlation between daily search volumes on the topic related to COVID-19 and the daily number of people infected with SARS-CoV-2 was analyzed. The overall search trend of RSV regarding COVID-19 increased during the early period of observing time and reached the first apex on 31 January 2020. A shorter response time and a longer duration of public attention to COVID-19 was observed in public from the USA, the UK, Australia, and Canada, than that in Ireland and New Zealand. A slightly positive correlation between daily RSV about COVID-19 and the daily number of confirmed cases was observed (<0.05). People across countries presented a various interest to the RSV on COVID-19, and public awareness of COVID-19 was different in various sub-regions within countries. The results suggest that public response time to COVID-19 was different across countries, and the overall duration of public attention was short.”

According to the news editors, the research concluded: “The current study reminds us that governments should strengthen the publicity of COVID-19 nationally, strengthen the public’s vigilance and sensitivity to COVID-19, inform public the importance of protecting themselves with enough precautionary measures, and finally control the spread of COVID-19 globally.”

3005005375,"Google, Apple contact tracing API hits the market, 3 states commit to using it in apps: Apple and Google on May 20 launched their interoperable API, designed to measure contact tracing using Bluetooth technology in smart phones, to help public health agencies rapidly track COVID-19 spread and notify individuals exposed to the virus.","Apple and Google on May 20 launched their interoperable API, designed to measure contact tracing using Bluetooth technology in smart phones, to help public health agencies rapidly track COVID-19 spread and notify individuals exposed to the virus.

Smartphone users in some areas will soon be able to download an app to trace who they are in contact with and notify them if they come into contact with an individual who has tested positive for COVID-19. Google and Apple worked together to make the API so the technology would register on both iPhone and Android phones. Public health agencies can use the API in their own apps for users to install.

Alabama, North Dakota and South Carolina have all committed to using the API in statewide apps designed to slow the spread of COVID-19, according to CNBC. The apps will depend on users downloading them and then self-reporting when they test positive for COVID-19. There are 22 countries and a few more states that have received information about the APIs on request.

Apps built with the API won't be able to use GPS data that pinpoints user location and government agencies will not be able to turn the technology on without the users' knowledge.

3004925304,"Warehouses are the new darling of commercial real-estate thanks to a surge in e-commerce, with firms like Macy's and Boeing selling while Amazon snaps space up","The coronavirus crisis has caused commercial real-estate sales and leasing to grind to a near halt, but industrial space remains resilient.
Warehouses, which cater to growing e-commerce and logistics sectors, continue to find users and buyers. 
Experts say the coronavirus crisis has accelerated an ongoing transition of consumer spending from brick-and-mortar to online shopping, creating demand for tens of millions of square feet of warehouse space.
The country's largest industrial owner believes that the pandemic could create demand for over 500 million square feet of new industrial space in the next five years.

Covid-19 has shuttered stores, emptied hotels, and cast the future of the office workplace into doubt.
Yet one area of the property market remains resilient amid a historic blow to the country's real-estate sector.
Warehouses, once overlooked by investors as grimy relics of America's industrial past, have seen a surge of demand in recent years from both tenants and buyers as they have become key cogs for growing e-commerce and logistics businesses.
That interest has only grown amid the pandemic, which has appeared to accelerate a years-long shift away from traditional brick-and-mortar shopping to online commerce.




Confidence in the sector has pushed buyers, sellers and tenants to push ahead with deals at a moment when much of the rest of the commercial property market is frozen.
Lincoln Equities Group, for instance, just placed a nearly 200,000 square foot warehouse it is building on Long Island up for sale for over $70 million after leasing it to Home Depot, which will use it as a distribution hub for retail stores it operates in Nassau and Suffolk counties, according to a marketing document for the offering viewed by Business Insider. 
Last month, Link Industrial, Blackstone's industrial-property investment arm, completed a $650 million acquisition of a roughly seven million square foot portfolio of warehouse properties in Minnesota and Colorado.
Macy's, which has sought to raise cash to bolster its struggling department store business, hired Cushman  Wakefield recently to market a $200 million portfolio of warehouses, totaling nearly three million square feet that it occupies across the country.




And in Torrance, California, the jet maker Boeing is offering a warehouse it owns up for sale, according to a spokesman for the company. A source familiar with the property told Business Insider the property is 1451 Knox Street, a nearly 153,000-square-foot distribution warehouse with 12,000 square feet of office space. 
""It's the safest harbor of all the property investment types right now and what's making it that way is that it's still a growing industry,"" said Mark Kolsrud, senior vice president at the real estate services firm Colliers, who focuses on industrial deals in the Midwest an handled the sale of the Minnesota and Colorado properties to Link.
Read More: A surge in grocery deliveries is creating a huge opportunity for industrial real-estate developers. Here's how the coronavirus is transforming retail and warehousing.
Kolsrud said that he and his sales team have since begun marketing three other warehouse portfolios that together total about 3 million square feet and are also located across the Midwest. 




""It's not just Link, there's so much money and so many investors looking for product like this right now,"" Kolsrud said.
The pandemic has forced consumers to shop online, boosting the need for warehouse space
The country's warehouse market had already been strong in recent years.
Average asking rents nationally grew to $7.86 per square foot at the end of the first quarter, an increase of 2.6% from the end of the fourth quarter in 2019 and a 4.8% jump above asking rents during the same period a year ago, according to date from the real estate services and brokerage company CBRE. About 34 million square feet of warehouse space was absorbed during the quarter, pushing vacancy down to 4.5%, a near record low, CBRE reported.  
While the Covid-19 crisis has battered other areas of the property market, it could actually bolster warehouse fundamentals. 




Lockdowns that were imposed by municipalities across the country to stop the spread of the coronavirus have forced shoppers to migrate online for goods, including items such as groceries that had stubbornly low adoption rates for delivery among some consumers. Some experts believe that could translate into lasting e-commerce gains that would otherwise have taken years to accrue. 
""A shopper who wasn't comfortable with someone else picking out and delivering their bananas may have been forced to give it a try,"" said Jason Tolliver, who heads Cushman  Wakefield's national industrial real estate services practice. ""Not only do they realize that it works but they find out that it's pretty convenient too.""
Even seemingly small shifts in consumer retail spending away from stores to online shopping can translate into huge demand for the warehouse spaces that support digital commerce.
Chris Caton, the global head of research for Prologis, the country's largest owner of industrial space with an over 500 million square feet in the U.S. and nearly $130 billion of assets under management, said that a single percentage point increase in online shopping in the over $5 trillion that consumers have spent annually in recent years on retail purchases could create enough demand to fill 50 million square feet of new warehouse space.




E-commerce's share of retail spending grew from 10.5% in the first quarter of 2019 to 11.8% in the first quarter of 2020, according to data from the Census Bureau for the Department of Commerce.
Caton predicts e-commerce's share of spending will continue to increase and that other trends will also buttress the warehouse market, including demand for more storage space in the country's distribution network, which experienced shortages of goods and supplies amid the lockdown.
""We have had a model of just-in-time inventories that was exposed for its lack of resiliency during the crisis,"" Caton said. ""There's two factors at play in demand, the growth of e-commerce and the need to stockpile more goods so we have them on hand.""

In total, Caton predicted in excess of 500 million square feet of demand for new warehouse space in the next five years, a record amount.
One particularly robust areas of the warehouse market in recent years has been for spaces in and around major population centers that provide key last mile hubs to deliver products to consumers quickly.
Since the pandemic began, Amazon has committed to at least two such locations just outside New York City in New Jersey, a roughly 315,000 square foot warehouse at 1800 Lower Road in Linden and an 185,000 square foot space in Avenel at 1 Paddock Street.
The tech giant, which has surged to a $1.2 trillion market cap amid the pandemic, is also in continued negotiations to lease a roughly 700,000-square-foot warehouse that would be built for its occupancy in Maspeth, Queen. Those talks have persevered through the virus crisis, according to a source with direct knowledge of the deal.




A spokeswoman for Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
The continued leasing activity in the industrial market goes beyond just big names such as Amazon and Walmart that have gobbled up space in the sector for years.
""Amazon is a big piece of demand but they're not the only ones by any means,"" said Joe Taylor, the president and CEO of the New Jersey-based warehouse builder and investment firm Matrix Development Group. ""We're seeing increased activity by all the retailers on the e-commerce front.""
Taylor said his firm is negotiating with two tenants to lease a nearly 1 million square foot warehouse it is building near the Goethals Bridge in Staten Island. He said he couldn't yet disclose the potential takers vying for the space.




The building is the final warehouse in the 3.3 million square foot Matrix Global Logistics Park. Taylor's firm previously built and leased two warehouses at the project totaling about 1.3 million square feet to Amazon and another 975,000 square foot warehouse to Ikea to help it boost its e-ecommerce operations.

3004990871,"Dow Jones Futures: ASML, Intel, AMD Break Out In Coronavirus Market Rally; Apple, Google Just Below Buy Points","Dow Jones futures rose slightly late Wednesday, along with S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq futures. The coronavirus stock market rally rebounded strongly Wednesday from Tuesday's late sell-off. ASML extended a breakout while Intel, Advanced Micro Devices, KLA Corp. and Analog Devices cleared buy points.

Intel stock, AMD stock, KLAC stock and ADI stock made encouraging moves. However, ASML stock showed strong action Wednesday, while the chip-equipment maker has been a leader for quite some time.

Meanwhile, Apple and Google parent Alphabet advanced to a fraction below buy points.

Apple stock and AMD stock are on IBD Leaderboard. AAPL stock also is on SwingTrader. KLA stock and AMD stock are on the IBD 50 list, along with several chipmakers.

Intel and Apple are members of the Dow Jones, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite.

Dow Jones Futures Today

Dow Jones futures rose 0.2% vs. fair value. S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq 100 futures were up 0.2%. Remember that overnight action in Dow futures and elsewhere doesn't necessarily translate into actual trading in the next regular stock market session.

Coronavirus News

Coronavirus cases worldwide are above 5.05 million. Covid-19 deaths have reached 328,000.

Coronavirus cases in the U.S. are now at 1.58 million with deaths topping 94,000.

While new coronavirus cases are gradually slowing in the U.S. and coming under control in Europe, Russia, India and much of the Middle East are showing big increases. Brazil is a major hot spot, along with several other Latin American countries.

Coronavirus Stock Market Rally

The coronavirus stock market rally rebounded strongly from Tuesday's sell-off into the close. The Senate passage of a bill that could force Chinese companies to delist from U.S. markets curbed gains briefly, but the major indexes closed not far from session highs.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.5%, the S&P 500 index 1.7% and the Nasdaq composite 2.1%. The S&P 500 is nearing its 200-day line while its 50-day moving average has turned positive. The Nasdaq composite continues to lead the coronavirus market rally, nearing record highs as growth stocks power ahead.

Among the best ETFs, the iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF advanced 1.65%. The VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF popped 3.6%, with Intel stock, AMD stock and ASML stock among the notable holdings.

Read The Big Picture every day to stay in sync with the market direction and leading stocks and sectors.

ASML Stock

ASML stock rose 6.3% to 325.64. That extended Tuesday's lackluster breakout attempt above the buy point at 306. ASML stock also hit a new all-time high. Volume was slightly below normal, but the past few days have shown relatively high trading vs. the last few weeks.

The relative strength line for ASML stock was already at a new high before Wednesday's move, a bullish sign. The RS line, the blue line in the charts provided, has been trending higher since the start of 2019. That reflects ASML stock's outperformance vs. the S&P 500 index.

ASML stock is now slightly extended from the 306 entry. Shares could pull back into the 5% chase zone or consolidate near current levels to provide an alternative entry. ASML was the IBD Stock Of The Day.

Intel Stock, Other Chip Stocks Clear Buy Points

Intel stock jumped 4.7% to 63.10, above a 62.23 cup-with-handle buy point. A strong move for the Dow tech titan. But the RS line for Intel stock is not even above the handle high. More broadly, Intel hasn't been a leader among chips or the overall stock market for quite some time.

ADI stock popped 7.75% to 114.57, just above a 114.16 cup-with-handle buy point, according to MarketSmith analysis. Volume was strong, which is not surprising given the Analog Devices earnings report before Wednesday's open. As with Intel stock, ADI stock hasn't been a real chip or market leader in some time.

KLA stock rallied 3.1% to 177.92, nudging past a 117.27 buy point. Like fellow chip-equipment play ASML stock, the RS line for KLA stock has been trending higher for quite some time.

AMD stock rallied 1.7% to 56.39. That put the graphics-chip maker above a downward-sloping trend line, offering an aggressive entry. But for a second straight session AMD stock failed to close above a short-term level of 56.68. The official cup-with-handle buy point is 58.73. While AMD stock has been a chip and market leader, recently it's been lagging rivals such as Nvidia. Also, Nvdia earnings Thursday night could move AMD stock.

If nothing else, it's encouraging to see more chip stocks breaking out, joining software as a major tech sector leading the coronavirus stock market rally.

Apple Stock

Apple stock rose 1.9% to 319.23 on Wednesday, the highest close since Feb. 21. That's just below a 319.79 buy point — an alternate entry on a daily chart and an official cup-with-handle entry on a weekly chart. The RS line for AAPL stock is just below all-time highs, and has been trending higher for a long time.

Google Stock

Google stock rose 2.5% to 1,409.16, just a fraction below a 1,415.63 cup-with-handle entry.

The RS line for Google stock has been hitting new highs. But the FANG stock hasn't been a big market winner in the past few years.

3004988987,"Patent Issued for Methods And Apparatus For Synchronization Of Media Playback Within A Wireless Network (USPTO 10,645,659): Apple Inc.","2020 MAY 20 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Network Business Daily -- From Alexandria, Virginia, NewsRx journalists report that a patent by the inventors Powell, Richard (Cupertino, CA); Naito, Daniel (Cupertino, CA); Hollabaugh, James (Cupertino, CA); Klingler, Daniel (Cupertino, CA), filed on September 24, 2018, was published online on May 18, 2020.

The patent’s assignee for patent number 10,645,659 is Apple Inc. (Cupertino, California, United States).

News editors obtained the following quote from the background information supplied by the inventors: “The present disclosure relates generally to the field of multimedia processing. More particularly, the present disclosure is directed to precisely synchronizing media processing within a wireless network.

“As is well known within the electronic circuit design arts, high speed integrated circuit (IC) design typically requires consistent and accurate distribution of a time reference. Specifically, an accurate time reference is required to, inter alia, ensure that data is processed correctly and consistently throughout the integrated circuit. Media processing is one specific area of the processing arts where timing problems can result in performance issues that are easily perceptible to humans. For example, audio playback with a glitchy or irregular clock can result in audible artifacts and distortions. Similarly, video playback with poor quality clocks may result in visible freezing, ‘chunking’, etc. Typically, video errors on the order of a few milliseconds can be perceived whereas audio errors can be perceived within a few microseconds (the human ear is more sensitive to anomalies).

“For example, consider two or more wireless audio devices that are configured to provide a ‘stereo’ and/or ‘surround’ audio experience. If the wireless audio devices are not correctly synchronized, then the audio playback for one speaker will be slightly offset in time from the other speaker(s). Since the human brain interprets perceived volume differences and time differences as being caused by the virtual location of sound sources relative to the human, the slight offset in time will be interpreted as an incorrectly reproduced stereo image. Specifically, the resulting ‘inter-temporal distortion’ will be perceived as a stereo image that is not centered, but is off to one side. The human brain can detect time differences as small as 10 microseconds (e.g., typically half an audio sample).

“Wireless networks must robustly handle changing radio environments, unknown propagation delays, etc. Generally, wireless devices utilize an internal free-running oscillator to generate internal clocking. Due to manufacturing variance and tolerances in oscillator components, wireless networks must also assume that each device has an imperfect time reference. For this reason, a myriad of synchronization schemes and standards for synchronizing time between wireless devices have been developed. Typical solutions for network synchronization regularly provide time information across the wireless network; each device of the network determines an appropriate adjustment to its local free-running clock. Existing wireless synchronization techniques are accurate to only within a few milliseconds (which is magnitudes greater than the human brain’s audio acuity).

“Moreover, even though wireless systems can synchronize their internal clocks to a common time reference for modem operation, typical media processing is performed via a separate processor (e.g., an application processor). Accordingly, distortion-free media playback also requires that the media sub-system can receive a high quality time reference from the modem chip.”

As a supplement to the background information on this patent, NewsRx correspondents also obtained the inventors’ summary information for this patent: “The present disclosure provides, inter alia, improved apparatus and methods for precisely synchronizing media processing within a wireless network.

“A method for precisely synchronizing media processing within a network is disclosed. In one embodiment, the method includes: receiving a common time stamp of a common time reference; receiving media data associated with the common time reference; deriving a local version of the common time reference for media playback based on the common time stamp; and playing the media in accordance with the derived time reference.

“In one variant, the network comprises a wireless local area network (WLAN) and the common time reference comprises a time synchronization function (TSF) value received via a beacon. In some such variants, the local version of the common time reference is clocked from a free running clock oscillator. In some implementations, deriving the local version of the common time reference comprises determining a rate mismatch between the local version of the common time reference and the common time reference. In still other implementations, the determination of rate mismatch is based on an analysis of a plurality of observed time stamps and an ideal timeline derived from the plurality of observed time stamps.

“A method for interrupt driven time synchronization within a device is disclosed. In one embodiment, the method includes: generating a common event between a first and a second processor; observing a first number of clock cycles of the first processor during the common event; observing a second number of clock cycles of the second processor during the common event; determining a rate mismatch based on the first and second number; correcting one or more media samples for playback on the first processor based on the determined rate mismatch; and where the one or more media samples are provided by the second processor.

“In some variants, the common event comprises a pulse width generated by the first processor setting a latch, and responsively the second processor resetting the latch. In some cases, the method also includes receiving one or more time stamps via a main link. In such variants, the received one or more time stamps may be associated with at least one edge of the pulse width.

“A wireless media device configured to receive media via a wireless network is disclosed. In one embodiment, the wireless media device includes: a first and a second processor; a first clock associated with the first processor and a second clock associated with the second processor; and a non-transitory computer readable medium comprising one or more instructions. In one exemplary embodiment, the one or more instructions are configured to cause the first processor to, when executed: request a time synchronization event; observe a first number of first clock cycles of the first clock during a common event; receive a second number of second clock cycles of the second clock during the common event; and determine a rate mismatch based on the first and second number; and correct one or more media samples for playback based on the determined rate mismatch.

“In one variant, the first and second processor comprise an application processor and a wireless modem. In one exemplary variant, the one or more instructions are further configured to cause the first processor to, when executed: set a latch; where the second processor is configured to responsively reset the latch; and measure a pulse width generated by the latch. In some variants, the media comprises one or more audio data streamed via the wireless network.

“In other variants, the wireless modem is time synchronized to the wireless network. In certain implementations, the one or more instructions are further configured to cause the first processor to, when executed: receive a time stamp via an out-of-band link with the second processor, the time stamp associated with the common event.

“In some variants, the one or more media samples are streaming audio samples.

“In still other variants, the second clock is selected to oscillate at a frequency that is substantially similar to a radio frequency of the wireless network. In some implementations, the first clock is selected according to one or more processor capabilities.

“In some variants, the received second number of second clock cycles is received via an out-of-band link with the second processor.

“In other variants, the rate mismatch is determined based on historic measurements.

“In another aspect, a non-transitory computer-readable apparatus is disclosed. In one embodiment, the non-transitory computer-readable apparatus includes a storage medium, the storage medium including a computer program having a plurality of instructions configured to, when executed by a processor apparatus, cause a media device to: determine a rate mismatch; derive a parameter based on the determined rate mismatch; and correct a rate of playback of the one or more media samples based on the determined rate mismatch and a dynamic adjustment of the derived parameter during the playback.

“Other features and advantages of the present disclosure will immediately be recognized by persons of ordinary skill in the art with reference to the attached drawings and detailed description of exemplary embodiments as given below.”

3005001559,Patent Application Titled “Variable Rate Shading” Published Online (USPTO 20200134913): Microsoft Technology Licensing LLC,"2020 MAY 20 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Technology Business Daily -- According to news reporting originating from Washington, D.C., by NewsRx journalists, a patent application by the inventors NEVRAEV, Ivan (Redmond, WA); FULLER, Martin J. I. (Warwick, GB); GROSSMAN, Mark S. (Palo Alto, CA); GOULD, Jason M. (Woodinville, WA), filed on December 30, 2019, was made available online on April 30, 2020.

The assignee for this patent application is Microsoft Technology Licensing LLC (Redmond, Washington, United States).

Reporters obtained the following quote from the background information supplied by the inventors: “The present aspects relate to a computer device, and more particularly, to performing variable sample rate shading in rendering graphics on a computer device.

“Computer graphics systems, which can render 2D objects or objects from a 3D world (real or imaginary) onto a two-dimensional (2D) display screen, are currently used in a wide variety of applications. For example, 3D computer graphics can be used for real-time interactive applications, such as video games, virtual reality, scientific research, etc., as well as off-line applications, such as the creation of high resolution movies, graphic art, etc. Typically, the graphics system includes a graphics processing unit (GPU). A GPU may be implemented as a co-processor component to a central processing unit (CPU) of the computer, and may be provided in the form of an add-in card (e.g., video card), co-processor, or as functionality that is integrated directly into the motherboard of the computer or into other devices, such as a gaming device.

“Typically, the GPU has a ‘logical graphics pipeline,’ which may accept as input some representation of a 2D or 3D scene and output a bitmap that defines a 2D image for display. For example, the DIRECTX collection of application programming interfaces by MICROSOFT CORPORATION, including the DIRECT3D API, is an example of APIs that have graphic pipeline models. Another example includes the Open Graphics Library (OPENGL) API. The graphics pipeline typically includes a number of stages to convert a group of vertices, textures, buffers, and state information into an image frame on the screen. For instance, one of the stages of the graphics pipeline is a shader. A shader is a piece of code running on a specialized processing unit, also referred to as a shader unit or shader processor, usually executing multiple data threads at once, programmed to generate appropriate levels of color and/or special effects to fragments being rendered. In particular, for example, a vertex shader processes traits (position, texture coordinates, color, etc.) of a vertex, and a pixel shader processes traits (texture values, color, z-depth and alpha value) of a pixel. The prior art typically uses a constant sampling rate within the graphics pipeline for rendering an entire frame. Because of the desire for high-fidelity images, pixel shading is typically performed at a per-pixel rate, or at the rate of N samples per pixel if N-multisample anti-aliasing is required. Thus, the computer device operates the graphics pipeline to convert information about 3D objects into a bit map that can be displayed, and this process requires considerable memory and processing power.

“There are continuing increases in pixel density and display resolution, and a continuing desire for power reduction in mobile display devices, like the HOLOLENS holographic headset device by MICROSOFT CORPORATION. Therefore, there is a need in the art for more efficient graphics processing in a computer device.”

In addition to obtaining background information on this patent application, NewsRx editors also obtained the inventors’ summary information for this patent application: “The following presents a simplified summary of one or more aspects in order to provide a basic understanding of such aspects. This summary is not an extensive overview of all contemplated aspects, and is intended to neither identify key or critical elements of all aspects nor delineate the scope of any or all aspects. Its sole purpose is to present some concepts of one or more aspects in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is presented later.

“One aspect relates to a method of rendering graphics in a computer system, including determining, by a GPU at a rasterization stage, map coordinates based on coarse scan converting a primitive of an object, the map coordinates indicating a location on a sampling rate parameter (SRP) map of a fragment within the primitive of the object. Further, the method includes identifying, by the GPU at the rasterization stage, a lookup value for the fragment within the primitive of the object based at least on the map coordinates. Further, the method includes calculating, by the GPU at the rasterization stage, a respective fragment variable SRP value for the fragment within the primitive of the object based at least on the lookup value. Additionally, the method includes shading, by the GPU at a pixel shader stage, the fragment within the primitive of the object based on the respective fragment variable SRP value.

“In another aspect, a computer device includes a memory and a graphics processing unit (GPU) in communication with the memory. The GPU is configured to determine, at a rasterization stage, map coordinates based on coarse scan converting a primitive of an object, the map coordinates indicating a location on a SRP map of a fragment within the primitive of the object. Further, the GPU is configured to identify, at the rasterization stage, the lookup value for the fragment within the primitive of the object based at least on the map coordinates. Further, the GPU is configured to calculate, at the rasterization stage, a respective fragment variable SRP value for the fragment within the primitive of the object based at least on the lookup value. Additionally, the GPU is configured to shade, at a pixel shader stage, the fragment within the primitive of the object based on the respective fragment variable SRP value.

“In a further aspect, a computer-readable medium storing computer-executable instructions executable by a processor for rendering graphics in a computer device includes various instructions. The computer-readable medium includes instructions for determining, by a GPU at a rasterization stage, map coordinates based on coarse scan converting a primitive of an object, the map coordinates indicating a location on a SRP map of a fragment within the primitive of the object. Further, computer-readable medium includes instructions for identifying, by the GPU at the rasterization stage, a lookup value for the fragmens within the primitive of the object based at least on the map coordinates. Also, the computer-readable medium includes instructions for calculating, by the GPU at the rasterization stage, a respective fragment variable SRP value for the fragment within the primitive of the object based at least on the lookup value. Additionally, the computer-readable medium includes instructions for shading, by the GPU at a pixel shader stage, the fragment within the primitive of the object based on the respective fragment variable SRP value.

“Additional advantages and novel features relating to aspects of the present invention will be set forth in part in the description that follows, and in part will become more apparent to those skilled in the art upon examination of the following or upon learning by practice thereof.”

3004989208,"Patent Issued for Electronic Device Having Multiple Antennas With Shared Structures For Near-Field Communications And Non-Near-Field Communications (USPTO 10,644,758): Apple Inc.","2020 MAY 20 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Network Business Daily -- Apple Inc. (Cupertino, California, United States) has been issued patent number 10,644,758, according to news reporting originating out of Alexandria, Virginia, by NewsRx editors.

The patent’s inventors are Irci, Erdinc (Sunnyvale, CA); Wang, Han (San Jose, CA); Atmatzakis, Georgios (Cupertino, CA); Ayala Vazquez, Enrique (Watsonville, CA); Tong, Erica J. (Pacifica, CA); Gao, Xu (Santa Clara, CA); Hu, Hongfei (Cupertino, CA); Jin, Nanbo (San Jose, CA); Pascolini, Mattia (San Francisco, CA).

This patent was filed on February 1, 2019 and was published online on May 18, 2020.

From the background information supplied by the inventors, news correspondents obtained the following quote: “This relates to electronic devices, and more particularly, to antennas for electronic devices with wireless communications circuitry.

“Electronic devices such as portable computers and cellular telephones are often provided with wireless communications capabilities. For example, electronic devices may use long-range wireless communications circuitry such as cellular telephone circuitry to communicate using cellular telephone bands. Electronic devices may use short-range wireless communications circuitry such as wireless local area network communications circuitry to handle communications with nearby equipment. Electronic devices may also be provided with satellite navigation system receivers and other wireless circuitry such as near-field communications circuitry. Near-field communications schemes involve electromagnetically coupled communications over short distances, typically 20 cm or less.

“To satisfy consumer demand for small form factor wireless devices, manufacturers are continually striving to implement wireless communications circuitry such as antenna components using compact structures. At the same time, there is a desire for wireless devices to cover a growing number of communications bands. For example, it may be desirable for a wireless device to cover a near-field communications band while simultaneously covering additional non-near-field (far-field) bands such cellular telephone bands, wireless local area network bands, and satellite navigation system bands.

“Because antennas have the potential to interfere with each other and with components in a wireless device, care must be taken when incorporating antennas into an electronic device. Moreover, care must be taken to ensure that the antennas and wireless circuitry in a device are able to exhibit satisfactory performance over a range of operating frequencies. In addition, it is often difficult to perform wireless communications with a satisfactory data rate (data throughput), especially as software applications performed by wireless devices become increasingly data hungry.

“It would therefore be desirable to be able to provide improved wireless communications circuitry for wireless electronic devices.”

Supplementing the background information on this patent, NewsRx reporters also obtained the inventors’ summary information for this patent: “An electronic device may be provided with wireless circuitry and a housing having a peripheral conductive wall. A dielectric-filled gap in the peripheral conductive wall may divide the peripheral conductive wall into first and second segments. The wireless circuitry may include antenna structures. For example, the wireless circuitry may include a first antenna having a first resonating element arm formed from the first segment and a first antenna feed coupled between the first segment and the antenna ground. The wireless circuitry may include a second antenna having a second resonating element arm formed from the second segment and a second antenna feed coupled between the second segment and the antenna ground.

“The wireless circuitry may include non-near-field communications transceiver circuitry coupled to the first and second antenna feeds and configured to convey non-near-field communications signals using the first and second antennas. The non-near-field communications transceiver circuitry may concurrently convey the non-near-field communications signals over both the first and second antennas using the same non-near-field communications frequencies under a multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) scheme. The dielectric-filled opening in the peripheral conductive wall may ensure that the first and second antennas are electromagnetically isolated at these frequencies.

“The wireless circuitry may include near-field communications transceiver circuitry coupled to the second segment over a first inductor and configured to convey near-field communications signals over a conductive loop path that forms a loop antenna resonating element for a near-field communications loop antenna. A second inductor may be coupled between the first and second segments across the dielectric-filled opening. An inductive return path may be coupled between the first segment and the antenna ground. Capacitor circuitry may be used to prevent non-near-field communications signals from interfering with the near-field communications transceiver circuitry. The first and second inductors may isolate the first and second antennas at non-near-field communications frequencies. The conductive loop path for the near-field communications loop antenna may include the first and second segments of the peripheral conductive housing wall, the first and second inductors, the inductive return path, and portions of the antenna ground. In this way, the same antenna structures may be used to perform both non-near-field communications under a MIMO scheme (e.g., with maximal data throughput) and near-field communications while maximizing the volume of the near-field communications loop path.”

3004993359,New Geology Study Results Reported from University of Brasilia [U-th-pb Shrimp Dating of Hydrothermal Monazite From the Trairao Gold Deposit - Alta Floresta Gold Province (Amazon Craton)]: Geology,"2020 MAY 20 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at NewsRx Science Daily -- Investigators publish new report on Geology. According to news reporting originating in Brasilia, Brazil, by NewsRx journalists, research stated, “Alta Floresta Gold Province occurs in the center-south portion of the Amazon Craton. Trairao gold deposit, which is located in the Alta Floresta Gold Province, is hosted by 1878 to 1854 Ma arc-related granites.”

Financial supporters for this research include Postgraduate Program of Geosciences of Universidade de Brasilia (UnB), Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq), Curtin University of Technology, UWA.

The news reporters obtained a quote from the research from the University of Brasilia, “Two important Au deposits take place in the region, the Trairao and Chumbo Grosso, which are structurally controlled by N80 degrees W/S80 degrees E trending lineament and associated with quartz veins and disseminated sulfides in a strong phyllic alteration zone of the host granite. Hydrothermal monazite grains formed during the Au mineralization event occur as fine anhedral crystals filling fractures or as isolated grains associated with Ag, Au, molybdenite, barite, pyrite, galena, and sphalerite. The hydrothermal monazite grains contain very low U, relatively low Th, and moderate Nd and La contents. SHRIMP U-Th-Pb dating of these crystals yielded an age of 1798 +/- 12 Ma for Trairao and 1805 +/- 22 Ma for Chumbo Grosso Au-deposits, whereas magmatic zircon grains of the granitic host rocks yielded an age of 1854 +/- 8 Ma. The ages obtained in this paper are similar to those reported by Assis (2015), who studied Pe Quente (Re-Os in molybdenite, 1792 +/- 9 Ma and 1784 +/- 11) and Francisco deposits (Ar-40-Ar-39 ages from sericitic halo: 1779 +/- 6.2 and 1777 +/- 6.3 Ma). Serrato et al. (2014) acquired Re-Os dating in pyrite and molybdenite from Juruena gold deposit. The results show isochronous ages at 1786 +/- 1 Ma, with a model age at 1787 +/- 3.2 Ma, suggesting a major Statherian gold metallogenic event at the Alta Floresta Gold Province region.”

According to the news reporters, the research concluded: “Regional fluids-flow has a close relationship with the generation and concentration of several important economic deposits in the Eastern border of Alta Floresta Gold Province, including Pe Quente, Francisco, Juruena, Chumbo Grosso, and Trairao Au-deposits.”

3005000548,"Patent Issued for Extensible System Action For Sharing While Remaining In Context (USPTO 10,642,669): Microsoft Technology Licensing LLC","2020 MAY 20 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Technology Business Daily -- According to news reporting originating from Alexandria, Virginia, by NewsRx journalists, a patent by the inventors Messerly, Katie (Bothell, WA); Clark, Christopher (Seattle, WA); Zhao, Feng (Bellevue, WA); Kabir, Ahsan (Seattle, WA); Tritschler, Olivier (Lake Forest Park, WA); Satterfield, Jesse Clay (Seattle, WA); Gloystein, Ginger (Seattle, WA); Chafins, Billie Sue (Seattle, WA); Lundberg, Patrik (Lake Forest Park, WA); Raghupathy, Sashi (Redmond, WA); Biswas, Manoj (Bellevue, WA); Thakker, Devang (Seattle, WA); Harris, Jensen (Kirkland, WA), filed on August 3, 2018, was published online on May 18, 2020.

The assignee for this patent, patent number 10,642,669, is Microsoft Technology Licensing LLC (Redmond, Washington, United States).

Reporters obtained the following quote from the background information supplied by the inventors: “Today electronic device users often share content with other users on the web using a variety of different mechanisms including e-mail, social networking sites, instant messaging, photo sharing sites, social bookmarking sites, and blogs, to name a few. However, many operating systems executing on the devices typically do not play a role in facilitating sharing. Instead, for example, users generally have to rely on generic functions like the clipboard to copy and paste content from one application/website to another, or they have to use sharing functionality provided by each individual application/website. Other current content sharing techniques include ‘drag and drop’ to move content from one application/website to another, and use of a file manager/browser application such as Microsoft Corporation’s Windows.RTM. Explorer which exposes extensibility points as COM (common object model) interfaces to enable sharing. Some web browser plug-ins can also currently facilitate content sharing.

“Although these current mechanisms function satisfactorily in some cases, they have limitations and are not specifically tailored for content sharing which can often make the user experience when sharing less than ideal. For example, users need to switch from their current application to use the clipboard to share content and applications/websites receiving the content do not specifically enable copy and paste with the clipboard to support sharing. Drag and drop is similarly limited by this lack of specific enablement for content sharing which can result in the user experience being cumbersome and not well streamlined. Using Explorer involves taking steps needed to store content for sharing locally and works only from Explorer and not for any content shown by a Windows application. Browser plug-ins for sharing are similarly limited to working just in the browser and cannot be extended to content shown by a Windows application.

“This Background is provided to introduce a brief context for the Summary and Detailed Description that follow. This Background is not intended to be an aid in determining the scope of the claimed subject matter nor be viewed as limiting the claimed subject matter to implementations that solve any or all of the disadvantages or problems presented above.”

In addition to obtaining background information on this patent, NewsRx editors also obtained the inventors’ summary information for this patent: “An operating system provides an extensible share action to broker content sharing between applications executing on a computing platform such as a personal computer, tablet computer, or smartphone. The share action enables a consistent user experience for content sharing to be implemented across all applications and eliminates users having to switch from the current application they are using to some other functionality in order to share content. Applications can participate with the operating system share action as source applications and/or target applications. Source applications may describe what content is shareable given the current state of their application when the user chooses to invoke the share action. Target applications can be configured to receive the shared content from the source application according to content type, and will expose a companion view of their application to the user that is specifically tailored to facilitate sharing.

“In various illustrative examples, target applications register the content types they can accept and target application developers are responsible for building the specifically tailored companion view of the application that is executed on the platform during content sharing. The user can access the share action by invoking an action space that is available from anywhere (e.g., the desktop, all user interfaces (UIs), and all applications) at any time. The action space provides a consistent entry point to a set of system actions, one of which is the share action. So if a user is looking at a picture using a source application such as a picture viewer, and selects the share action from the action space, a filtered list of target applications that can accept the shareable content by content type (e.g., photographs in this example) is displayed on a share UI. Target applications can include any of a variety of applications such as social networking, e-mail, photo sharing, other communication applications, and the like. The target applications facilitate content sharing with various different sharing endpoints including websites, individuals, multiple people, or categories of people.

“When a user selects a target application from the list, the operating system launches the companion view of that application and the user completes his or her share in that application. This interaction means that the source and the target applications do not need to be aware of one another--they can simply participate in the present sharing paradigm by describing shareable content that they can provide as a source application or that they can accept as a target. The operating system acts as the broker for the sharing by passing the content and other information such as content properties and metadata in some cases, from the source to the target application. When the user share action is complete, the target application passes a message to the operating system to close the UI of the companion view. It can also pass back a shortcut that describes the action the user just completed. When the user performs a subsequent share, the shortcut can be presented to the user in the share UI as part of a list of frequently used user-actions. The target application may upload the shared content to the appropriate sharing endpoint, for example as a background process.

“Advantageously, the present share action enables users to maintain the context of an interaction with a given application without having to leave what they are doing, start up another application, or open up another tab in a browser, and then perform multiple steps to implement sharing using the current techniques. Utilization of the companion view of the target application further enhances the user experience when sharing by tailoring the UI and functionality to sharing specifically as compared with the sub optimal experience that is commonly experienced when using generic techniques.

“This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used as an aid in determining the scope of the claimed subject matter.”

3004971160,Dow Jumps Nearly 400 Points As Amazon And Facebook Hit New Record Highs,"TOPLINE


The market finished higher on Wednesday, thanks to solid retail earnings and increasing optimism on Wall Street about an economic recovery, with stocks shrugging off President Trump’s latest criticism of China over its handling of coronavirus.

KEY FACTS



The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.5%, nearly 400 points, on Wednesday, while the S&P 500 was up 1.7% and the Nasdaq gained 2.1%.

Sentiment was lifted by strong earnings from major retailers like Lowe’s and Target, which both saw same-store sales jump in the first quarter thanks to heightened demand amid the pandemic.

Tech shares led the gains on Wednesday: Facebook and Amazon both hit new all-time highs, with their stocks rising 6.4% and 2%, respectively.

The market managed to move higher despite President Trump again criticizing China about its handling of coronavirus, blaming the country’s “incompetence” for “this mass Worldwide killing.” 

His hard-line stance on China has some experts worried that he could terminate the phase one trade deal, which he has threatened to do in the past. 

Stocks fell from their session highs after the Senate passed a new bill that would increase financial oversight of Chinese companies and ban some of them from listing on U.S. exchanges, like the NASDAQ or NYSE.


What to watch for


“I do not want to get into a new Cold War,” Senator John Kennedy (R-La.), who introduced the bill to ban Chinese companies from U.S. stock exchanges, said on Wednesday. “All I want, and I think all the rest of us want, is for China to play by the rules.”
Key background


The market rally on Wednesday comes amid a volatile week so far on Wall Street. On Monday, stocks had their biggest rally in six weeks, with the S&P and Dow both rising by more than 3% amid rising optimism over a coronavirus vaccine. Biotech company Moderna reported positive data from its early-stage coronavirus vaccine trial, causing its shares to surge 20% and leading the market higher. But stocks fell on Tuesday, after a report from STAT News raised concerns about Moderna’s trial results. The Dow lost 1.6%, almost 400 points, while the S&P 500 was down 1% and the Nasdaq 0.5%. The Congressional Budget Office released a bleak outlook on economic growth and unemployment on Tuesday, predicting a 38% drop in second-quarter GDP as 26 million Americans remain without a job. In a joint testimony before the Senate the same day, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin warned of the “risk of permanent damage” if state economies remain closed for too long, while Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said that more policy action may be necessary to offset the long-lasting economic damage caused by unemployment.
Crucial quote


“It seems traders should treat every trial result with caution, given the volatility around both Gilead and Moderna announcements over recent weeks,” says Joshua Mahony, senior market analyst at IG. “Every specialist seems to indicate that a vaccine will take some time to develop, yet markets treat each trial announcement like we are on the cusp of a huge breakthrough that could see  everything swiftly return to normal.”

(Santa Cruz, CA); Morichere-Matte, Stephane (Vancouver, CA); Rayner, Michael John (Vancouver, CA); Searcy, Matthew James (Vancouver, CA); Wardrip-Fruin, Noah Glenn (Santa Cruz, CA), filed on September 19, 2014, was published online on May 18, 2020.

The assignee for this patent, patent number 10,642,873, is Microsoft Technology Licensing LLC (Redmond, Washington, United States).

Reporters obtained the following quote from the background information supplied by the inventors: “A growing population of users interact with consumer devices and gaming consoles using voice commands. Although existing consumer devices translate a user’s voice to invoke actions, such as a web search or a phone call, existing consumer products are limited in that they are unable to maintain a meaningful conversation with the user. For example, when a user presents a question to a voice-enabled device, typical computers only generate a contrived, short answer.

“Existing systems might also be limited by the amount of information they can deliver to an application or remote service. For example, when interacting with a search engine, existing voice-enabled systems are generally limited to communicating a short, translated string to the search engine. Existing voice-enabled systems do not generally provide any substantive interaction beyond this type of exchange. To most users, the typical computer-generated responses of existing voice-enabled systems feel mechanical and unnatural. Such interactions are limited in providing users with a fulfilling experience.

“It is with respect to these and other considerations that the disclosure made herein is presented.”

In addition to obtaining background information on this patent, NewsRx editors also obtained the inventors’ summary information for this patent: “Concepts and technologies are described herein for providing dynamically sequenced natural language interactions between a user and a voice-enabled computing device. In one aspect, a computing device managing a conversation with a user is enhanced with the identification and management of one or more topics. Using techniques described herein, the computing device can focus on one or more topics, shift between topics and/or introduce new topics.

“Techniques disclosed herein might also manage and process various types of interruptions that are introduced during the conversation. Techniques disclosed herein dynamically access contextual information from a number of resources to generate contextually-relevant statements and to balance priorities between various topics. Individual topics may be identified and introduced to the conversation in response to a particular user input, event or scenario. Each topic may also have an associated decay rate, so the lifespan of individual topics may emulate realistic scenarios. In addition, the priorities of individual topics may be dynamically adjusted so topics are more aligned with events created by the user and the computing device.

“In embodiments disclosed herein, a computing device, such as a personal computer or gaming console, includes a program module that controls a wide range of features of a platform or an application, such as an operating system, office productivity application or gaming application. The program module analyzes scenario data, user history data, speech data and other contextual information to determine a context of a conversation between a user and a computer.

“In response to receiving an actionable input, which may include a speech input, a text input and/or an event, the program module may generate a response based on the broader context of the conversation. The response may be in a speech or text form. The response may also be in the form of an action or execution of one or more functions of the program module. As the conversation and events progress, the program module manages priorities of the topics, and the priorities of individual topics may increase or decrease based on events and/or other factors.

“The techniques described herein might also be utilized to provide automatic inclusion of contextual awareness, which allows the program module to dynamically introduce topics. According to various embodiments, a topic may be introduced randomly or manually. In addition, a topic may be automatically introduced based on a given situation or action. For instance, the introduction of a topic may be based on an event, scenario or the introduction of specific contextual data, such as the user’s progress in a game, the user’s profile data, the user’s speech input and/or other types of input.

“According to various embodiments, the program module provides a number of mechanisms to manage the priority of an individual topic. For instance, the priority of a topic may change over time, and the change may be based on a number of factors such as a decay rate, a user input and/or an event. For instance, the priority of a particular topic may start at a high level, and the priority may be reduced each time a new topic is raised. In another example, the priority of a particular topic may increase as new topics are raised. In yet another example, the priority of a particular topic may decay over time. By dynamically managing the priorities of individual topics, techniques disclosed herein may provide contextually relevant actions and/or contextually relevant content when generating responses to an input, such as a user speech input.

“It should be appreciated that the above-described subject matter may also be implemented as a computer-controlled apparatus, a computer process, a computing system, or as an article of manufacture such as a computer-readable medium. These and various other features will be apparent from a reading of the following Detailed Description and a review of the associated drawings.

“This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended that this Summary be used to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter. Furthermore, the claimed subject matter is not limited to implementations that solve any or all disadvantages noted in any part of this disclosure.”

3005000823,"Patent Issued for Interactive Addition Of Semantic Concepts To A Document (USPTO 10,642,937): Microsoft Technology Licensing LLC","2020 MAY 20 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Technology Business Daily -- From Alexandria, Virginia, NewsRx journalists report that a patent by the inventor Hurst, Matthew Francis (Seattle, WA), filed on February 13, 2017, was published online on May 18, 2020.

The patent’s assignee for patent number 10,642,937 is Microsoft Technology Licensing LLC (Redmond, Washington, United States).

News editors obtained the following quote from the background information supplied by the inventors: “Today, people from all walks of life publish content on the web. For example, many people write blogs or microblogs that discussing everything from their daily activities, to scientific breakthroughs, to commentary on recent newsworthy events. Others still publish articles related to a topic that they believe will somehow serve a public need, such as how-to manuals, for example. Commonly, once these posting are published, a webhost or other provider will search the content for unique terms and tag the term with a link and/or annotation. These links and/or annotations might help a user understand the context and/or meaning of the unique term, may relate to a product the webhost is paid to advertise, and/or may provide some other relevant information to a reader of the posting. For example, annotations are commonly inserted by a webhost and/or an advertising company associated with the webhost to surface advertisements that are relevant to the topic of the posting, and thus are targeted to the readers of the posting. When a reader selects the unique term, or hovers over the term, a box containing the annotation appears and provides the reader with the additional content related to the unique term.”

As a supplement to the background information on this patent, NewsRx correspondents also obtained the inventor’s summary information for this patent: “This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to identify key factors or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.

“Among other things, one or more systems and/or techniques for suggesting to an author semantic concepts (e.g., a unique identifier such as a URN, URL, etc.) that can be inserted into a document the author is creating are provided herein. Stated differently, as an author is creating a document (e.g., a web article, blog, etc.), unique terms can be identified, and semantic concepts related to the identified terms can be suggested to the author. The author can choose one or more semantic concepts that can be associated with the respective identified unique term(s). In one embodiment, the semantic concepts can be inserted into the document as annotations, which surface when a reader of the document selects the unique term.

“Sometimes, a semantic concept that the user wants to associate with a unique term is unavailable. For example, some unique terms may have no semantic concepts associated with them and/or the semantic concepts that are associated with a unique term may be inappropriate/undesirable for the author’s document. In these and other circumstances, the author may create a semantic concept for the unique term (which can then be stored for later use the author and/or other authors). Thus, where a desired semantic concept does not exists, an author can create a semantic concept that can be inserted into the document as an annotation, for example.

“It will be appreciated that the systems and/or techniques described herein provide benefits to the author, readers of the content, and to aggregators of the content. Authors benefit through the interaction (e.g., semantic concepts are suggested to the author rather than being automatically inserted into the document). Thus, the author plays an active role in determining what terms are further defined through annotations. Readers and aggregators benefit because the author (e.g., as opposed to a computer algorithm) selects the semantic concepts that better define the unique terms in his or her document. Thus, the semantic concepts that are displayed may be more relevant to the content of the document, and the aggregators may have more information to use when indexing the document and/or when determining whether to surface the document as a result of a search query.

“To the accomplishment of the foregoing and related ends, the following description and annexed drawings set forth certain illustrative aspects and implementations. These are indicative of but a few of the various ways in which one or more aspects may be employed. Other aspects, advantages, and novel features of the disclosure will become apparent from the following detailed description when considered in conjunction with the annexed drawings.”

3005000859,"Researchers Submit Patent Application, “Custom Local Search”, for Approval (USPTO 20200133965): Microsoft Technology Licensing LLC","2020 MAY 20 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Technology Business Daily -- From Washington, D.C., NewsRx journalists report that a patent application by the inventors Govindachetty, Narendranath Datha (Bangalore, IN); Joshi, Tanuja Abhay (Pune, IN); Joy, Joseph (Redmond, WA); Sengar, Vibhuti Singh (Redmond, WA), filed on September 5, 2019, was made available online on April 30, 2020.

The patent’s assignee is Microsoft Technology Licensing LLC (Redmond, Washington, United States).

News editors obtained the following quote from the background information supplied by the inventors: “Local search tools accessible by way of a browser are commonplace on the Internet. A user of such a tool directs the browser to a web page that corresponds to the local search tool by providing a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) that corresponds to the web page to the browser. The user then provides the local search tool with a location that is of interest to the user, which typically is the name of a city. Thereafter, the user can issue a query to the search tool, wherein the query is in the form of a name of a business/service or type of business/service (e.g., ‘pizza restaurants’). Typically, a search tool is configured to provide the user with a list of relevant organizations and corresponding contact data, including telephone numbers of the organizations, addresses of the organizations, etc. The search tool searches over and returns what is to be referred to herein as ‘yellow page data.’

“Typically, search tools receive yellow page data from consolidators who, in turn, generally rely upon specialized yellow page data collecting firms. The aggregated data is then considered as an aggregate pool of data on organizations, and searches are performed over this aggregate pool. The content of the yellow page data, therefore, is limited to that provided by the consolidators and/or yellow page data collecting firms. Additionally, the yellow page data is structured in such a manner that queries of a limited type and/or structure can be executed over such data. Still further, incorrect spelling of locations or services and/or otherwise imprecise queries can cause incorrect or no results to be returned to the user.”

As a supplement to the background information on this patent application, NewsRx correspondents also obtained the inventors’ summary information for this patent application: “The following is a brief summary of subject matter that is described in greater detail herein. This summary is not intended to be limiting as to the scope of the claims.

“Described herein are various technologies pertaining to local search in general, and custom local search in particular. Local search refers to searching for certain entities/services/attributes over a particular geographic location, such as a city, a street, an intersection of streets, etc. Custom local search refers to searching for certain entities/services/attributes over a particular geographic region, wherein the entities/services/attributes are included in custom content. Custom content refers to content provided by an independent entity, such as an end user, a community group, or other suitable person/group that is typically not associated with providing yellow page data to search engines.

“In an example, a community group may wish to provide a searchable site that maintains a user-provided list of pedestrian friendly features in a particular city. Such features may be, for instance, jogging trails, water fountains, playgrounds, etc. This data (referred to as ‘custom data’ herein) may be provided to a system that facilitates searching over such data in a particular format--each entity (in this example) may comprise a shape and an attribute that describes the entity. The shape can be indicative of a geographic region pertaining to the entity (e.g., may be a polygon describing a location of the entity on a map). The system that receives the data may perform one or more preprocessing actions to cause the data to be searchable by others, including generating precomputed indexes and attribute footprints that describe the union of geometries of entities that share a particular attribute. The data can be placed in the form of a logically independent dataset, and the system can update the dataset (including the indexes and footprints) when additional data is received by the community group. The system described herein supports searching over multiple of these datasets, which can be referred to herein as ‘custom datasets’.

“The system can additionally support or have access to one or more contextual datasets, which can comprise detailed geographic data (e.g., street-level geographic data). This geographic data can be vector data, which may include precise geometry of streets, landmarks, localities, boundaries, etc. A free-form textual query configured to retrieve data pertaining to a geographic location can be received, and such textual query can be parsed such that different subsequences of tokens in the query are mapped to different sets of entities in the datasets (the custom dataset(s) and the contextual dataset(s)). The subsequences can be mapped to entities in the dataset(s) utilizing any suitable technique; however, subsequences of tokens may not be mapped simultaneously to different entities in different datasets. Spatial processing can be undertaken to determine a substantially optimal interpretation of the query, and custom local results can be returned to the issuer of the query.

“In an example, the query may be ‘Seattle water fountains near 4.sup.th ave. and Pike St.’ ‘Seattle’ can map to boundary data in the contextual dataset, ‘4.sup.th ave.’ may map to certain vector data in the contextual dataset, and ‘Pike St.’ may map to other certain vector data in the contextual dataset. ‘Water fountains’ may map to a set of entities that have an attribute ‘fountain’ in the custom dataset. Using spatial processing (e.g., locating the intersection of 4.sup.th Avenue and Pike Street in the contextual database), mapping of subsequences of query tokens to particular entities in the datasets can be undertaken, and results can be displayed to the issuer of the query on a display screen of a computer device.

“Other aspects will be appreciated upon reading and understanding the attached figures and description.”

3005002273,"Patent Issued for Morphological Anti-Ringing Filter For Lossy Image Compression (USPTO 10,645,418): Google LLC","2020 MAY 20 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Internet Daily News -- From Alexandria, Virginia, NewsRx journalists report that a patent by the inventors Alakuijala, Jyrki (Wollerau, CH); Szabadka, Zoltan (Wollerau, CH), filed on April 13, 2018, was published online on May 18, 2020.

The patent’s assignee for patent number 10,645,418 is Google LLC (Mountain View, California, United States).

News editors obtained the following quote from the background information supplied by the inventors: “Image content (e.g., still images or frames of video) represents a significant amount of online content. For example, a web page may include multiple images, and a large portion of the time and resources spent rendering the web page are dedicated to rendering those images for display. The amount of time and resources required to receive and render an image for display depends in part on the manner in which the image is compressed. As such, an image can be rendered faster by reducing the total data size of the image using lossy compression and decompression techniques.

“Lossy compression techniques seek to represent image content using fewer bits than the number of bits in the original image. Lossy compression techniques can introduce visual artifacts, such as ringing artifacts, into the decompressed image. Higher compression levels can result in more observable ringing artifacts. It is desirable to minimize the ringing artifacts while maintaining high levels of compression.”

As a supplement to the background information on this patent, NewsRx correspondents also obtained the inventors’ summary information for this patent: “One aspect of this disclosure is a method for encoding a block of an image, wherein the block includes first values. The method includes generating a transform block for the block of first values, generating quantized transform coefficients for the transform block, determining a clamping value for the block, encoding the quantized transform coefficients in a compressed bitstream, and encoding the clamping value in the compressed bitstream. The clamping value is used to clamp second values. The second values correspond to the first values and result from inverse transforming the transform block.

“Another aspect is an apparatus for encoding blocks of an image, wherein the block includes first values. The apparatus includes a memory and a processor that is configured to execute instructions stored in the memory to generate a transform block for the block of first values, generate quantized transform coefficients for the transform block, determine a clamping value for the block, encode the clamping value in a compressed bitstream, and encode the quantized transform coefficients in the compressed bitstream. The clamping value is used to clamp second values. The second values correspond to the first values and result from inverse transforming the transform block.

“Another aspect is an apparatus for decoding a block of an image, wherein the apparatus includes a memory and a processor configured to execute instructions stored in the memory to decode, from a compressed bitstream, a quantized transform block; obtain, using the quantized transform block, a decoded block of pixel values; decode, from a compressed bitstream, a clamping value for the block; and clamp the pixel values using the clamping value.

3005000718,“Magnetic Fastening Assembly” in Patent Application Approval Process (USPTO 20200135372): Microsoft Technology Licensing LLC,"2020 MAY 20 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Technology Business Daily -- A patent application by the inventor SINGLA, Aseem (Bothell, WA), filed on October 30, 2018, was made available online on April 30, 2020, according to news reporting originating from Washington, D.C., by NewsRx correspondents.

This patent application is assigned to Microsoft Technology Licensing LLC (Redmond, Washington, United States).

The following quote was obtained by the news editors from the background information supplied by the inventors: “The present disclosure relates generally to fasteners and fastening devices/assemblies.

“Generally, a fastening mechanism such as a screw or snap feature may be used to attach two components of a device. However, the clean aesthetic requirements of a finished product in certain applications may make the use of unsightly screws and other snap features undesirable. Such aesthetic requirements may exist, for example, for display monitors and/or mobile devices with displays. Current solutions in such devices include, for instance, using adhesive to bond the display to a housing or chassis in a mobile phone or a laptop computer.

“More specifically, in some applications, Pressure Sensitive Adhesive (PSA) may be used to address such clean aesthetic requirements. PSA can achieve a clean and high-strength fastening mechanism. However, the ease of removal of a component that is attached by PSA is inversely proportional to the strength of the attachment, while using a higher strength PSA makes the removal process much more difficult in cases where there is a need for subsequent removal of a PSA-attached component.

“Accordingly, more practical fasteners and fastening mechanisms are needed.”

In addition to the background information obtained for this patent application, NewsRx journalists also obtained the inventor’s summary information for this patent application: “The following presents a simplified summary of one or more aspects in order to provide a basic understanding of such aspects. This summary is not an extensive overview of all contemplated aspects, and is intended to neither identify key or critical elements of all aspects nor delineate the scope of any or all aspects. Its sole purpose is to present some concepts of one or more aspects in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is presented later.

“In an aspect, a fastening assembly includes a first permanent magnet having a first operating temperature and a second permanent magnet having a second operating temperature lower than the first operating temperature. The first permanent magnet is attachable to the second permanent magnet in a locked state at a first temperature lower than the second operating temperature. The first permanent magnet is releasable from the second permanent magnet in an unlocked state at a second temperature that is higher than the second operating temperature.

“In a further aspect, a method is provided for using a fastening assembly including a first permanent magnet and a second permanent magnet. The method may include attaching a first surface of the first permanent magnet to a first component of a device, where the first permanent magnet has a first operating temperature. The method may further include attaching a second surface of the second permanent magnet to a second component of the device, where the second permanent magnet has a second operating temperature lower than the first operating temperature. The method may further include attaching the first component of the device to the second component of the device by aligning a third surface of the first permanent magnet opposite the first surface with a fourth surface of the second permanent magnet opposite the second surface so as to lock the first permanent magnet with the second permanent magnet at a first temperature lower than the second operating temperature.

“In another aspect, a fastening assembly kit includes a first permanent magnet having a first operating temperature and a second permanent magnet having a second operating temperature lower than the first operating temperature. The first permanent magnet is attachable to the second permanent magnet in a locked state at a first temperature lower than the second operating temperature. The first permanent magnet is releasable from the second permanent magnet in an unlocked state at a second temperature that is higher than the second operating temperature.

“To the accomplishment of the foregoing and related ends, the one or more aspects comprise the features hereinafter fully described and particularly pointed out in the claims. The following description and the annexed drawings set forth in detail certain illustrative features of the one or more aspects. These features are indicative, however, of but a few of the various ways in which the principles of various aspects may be employed, and this description is intended to include all such aspects and their equivalents.”

The claims supplied by the inventors are:

“1.

3005000949,"Patent Issued for Tool For Facilitating The Development Of New Language Understanding Scenarios (USPTO 10,643,035): Microsoft Technology Licensing LLC","2020 MAY 20 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Technology Business Daily -- According to news reporting originating from Alexandria, Virginia, by NewsRx journalists, a patent by the inventors Kim, Young-Bum (Bellevue, WA); Sarikaya, Ruhi (Redmond, WA); Rochette, Alexandre (Montreal, CA), filed on June 25, 2019, was published online on May 18, 2020.

The assignee for this patent, patent number 10,643,035, is Microsoft Technology Licensing LLC (Redmond, Washington, United States).

Reporters obtained the following quote from the background information supplied by the inventors: “A developer faces daunting challenges in adding natural language understanding (LU) functionality to an application. LU functionality is typically complex technology from both theoretical and practical standpoints. A developer may lack the required mastery of such technology to build the LU functionality. And even when the developer does possess the necessary knowhow to build the LU functionality, the process of building the LU functionality can be time-consuming, resource-intensive and expensive.”

In addition to obtaining background information on this patent, NewsRx editors also obtained the inventors’ summary information for this patent: “A computer-implemented technique is described herein for facilitating the creation of a natural language understanding (LU) component for use with an application. In one implementation, the technique allows a developer to select a subset of parameters (e.g., intents, slots, etc.) from a larger set of parameters. The subset of parameters defines a schema that pertains to the LU scenario to be handled by the application. In contrast, the larger set of parameters pertains to a plurality of LU scenarios handled by an already-existing generic LU model, associated with different respective domains of analysis. The technique provides a constrained LU component that is based on the subset of parameters in conjunction with the generic LU model. At runtime, the constrained LU component receives an input language item, e.g., an utterance or text input, from an end user. The constrained LU component interprets the input language item using the generic LU model in a manner that is constrained by the subset of parameters that has been selected, to provide an output result.

“In one manner of operation, the constrained LU component restricts the generic LU model by filtering an output result of the generic LU model based on the selected subset of parameters. In another manner of operation, the constrained LU component constrains the manner in which the generic LU model interprets the input linguistic item, e.g., by restricting the transitions of a decoding lattice used by the generic LU model based on the selected subset of parameters.

“According to another illustrative aspect, the technique allows the developer to author new rules and/or create supplemental statistical models. The developer may choose to create new rules and/or models when the preexisting generic LU model cannot meet all of the requirements of the new language understanding scenario.

“By virtue of the fact that the technique reuses and repurposes existing LU resources, the technique allows the developer to quickly and efficiently build an LU component, even when the developer is relatively inexperienced with respect to natural language understanding technology.

“The above technique can be manifested in various types of systems, devices, components, methods, computer-readable storage media, data structures, graphical user interface presentations, articles of manufacture, and so on.

“This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form; these concepts are further described below in the Detailed Description.

3004983135,"Patent Issued for Charging Multiple User Apparatuses (USPTO 10,644,516): Microsoft Technology Licensing LLC","2020 MAY 20 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Information Technology Business Daily -- From Alexandria, Virginia, NewsRx journalists report that a patent by the inventors Inha, Kai (Jarvenpaa, FI); Yliaho, Marko (Tampere, FI); Backman, Juha (Espoo, FI), filed on May 19, 2016, was published online on May 18, 2020.

The patent’s assignee for patent number 10,644,516 is Microsoft Technology Licensing LLC (Redmond, Washington, United States).

News editors obtained the following quote from the background information supplied by the inventors: “Electronic devices, for example, smart phones and tablet computers, need to be charged usually at daily basis in order to keep them operative. Especially earlier electronic devices included a device manufacturer specific charger and a charger port. Recently, a technology standard called Universal Serial Bus type-C (USB type-C and/or USB-C) was agreed between various device manufacturers and software providers. Traditionally it has been possible to convey operating or charging power only in one direction via a USB cable. The strength of the USB-C is that it is able to convey both operating or charging power and data in both directions. This also means that practically any electronic device connected to another electronic device using the USB-C may act as a charging entity. As an example, if a monitor is connected to a computer using the USB-C, only the monitor needs to be connected to the electric power network, and the monitor provides operating power to the computer via the USB-C.”

3005010909,“Machine Learning System For Taking Control Actions” in Patent Application Approval Process (USPTO 20200134628): Microsoft Technology Licensing LLC,"2020 MAY 20 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Disease Prevention Daily -- A patent application by the inventors JIA, Yuting (Redmond, WA); OKA, Anand Ravindra (Bellevue, WA); CHEN, Liang-Yu (Bothell, WA); WANG, Yiqing (Bellevue, WA); NANDURI, Jayaram Naga Mrutyum (Issaquah, WA), filed on October 26, 2018, was made available online on April 30, 2020, according to news reporting originating from Washington, D.C., by NewsRx correspondents.

This patent application is assigned to Microsoft Technology Licensing LLC (Redmond, Washington, United States).

The following quote was obtained by the news editors from the background information supplied by the inventors: “The present disclosure relates generally to machine learning-based control systems, and more particularly, to an integrated machine learning system for providing control actions.

“Machine learning-based systems may be used in various technological systems, however, they are often independently implemented. For example, systems that operate based on control actions at various stages may implement a machine learning model at each stage. One type of such a technical system may be, but is not limited to, a payment/transaction processing system. Generally, in the chain of events that happen during a purchase authentication/authorization and the corresponding back office flow, there may be several ‘control actions’ taken by the system for evaluating whether to process and/or for processing a purchase transaction. Taking overly restrictive control actions or loosening restrictions may result in inefficient system operation and/or may allow some fraudulent transactions.

“Generally, a transaction processing system may receive and process a very large number of transactions, e.g., thousands or millions of transactions per hour, per day, etc. If a machine learning-based infrastructure that supports taking control action on such transactions does not operate efficiently, large amounts of computing resources such as communication and processing resources will be needed to support the transaction processing system, and it may not even be possible to provide timely responses in case of resource scarcity. For example, if the transaction processing system takes sub-optimal control actions that result in rejection or other adverse decisions on legitimate transactions, or if the transaction processing system allows fraudulent transactions that are later identified as being fraudulent, the need to perform further processing and/or take further control actions on such transactions imposes an overhead on the system/network and takes up valuable computing resources, networking bandwidth, etc.

“Accordingly, more efficient systems and methods for configuring control actions are needed.”

In addition to the background information obtained for this patent application, NewsRx journalists also obtained the inventors’ summary information for this patent application: “The following presents a simplified summary of one or more aspects in order to provide a basic understanding of such aspects. This summary is not an extensive overview of all contemplated aspects, and is intended to neither identify key or critical elements of all aspects nor delineate the scope of any or all aspects. Its sole purpose is to present some concepts of one or more aspects in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is presented later.

The plurality of integrated control action models are machine learning models jointly trained for taking each control action of a plurality of control actions on the transaction to maximize an objective function based on a probability of the plurality of control actions matching corresponding target control actions taken on the transaction. The plurality of integrated control action models include at least a risk model configured to output risk prediction information for a first control action that indicates whether or not to initiate processing of the transaction. The method further includes receiving the risk prediction information from the risk model, and executing at least the first control action based on the risk prediction information.

The method may include receiving a current transaction and processing the current transaction by taking at least one control action using a joint learned model. The joint learned model includes at least a first learned model and a second learned model that are jointly trained for taking each control action of a plurality of control actions on at least one training transaction so as to maximize an expected value of an objective function associated with the at least one training transaction based on a probability of the plurality of control actions matching corresponding target control actions taken on the at least one training transaction using at least the first learned model and the second learned model.

(Jersey City, NJ); Sindhwani, Vikas (Hastings-on-Hudson, NY), filed on December 23, 2019, was made available online on April 30, 2020.

The assignee for this patent application is Google LLC (Mountain View, California, United States).

Reporters obtained the following quote from the background information supplied by the inventors: “This specification relates to neural network architectures and compressing neural networks.

“Neural networks are machine learning models that employ one or more layers of nonlinear units to predict an output for a received input. Some neural networks include one or more hidden layers in addition to an output layer. The output of each hidden layer is used as input to the next layer in the network, i.e., the next hidden layer or the output layer. Each layer of the network generates an output from a received input in accordance with current values of a respective set of parameters. Some neural networks, e.g., those that are designed for time series problems or sequence-to-sequence learning (recurrent neural networks (RNN)), incorporate recurrent loops which permit memory, in the form of a hidden state variable, to persist within a layer between data inputs. A variation of RNNs, long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks include multiple gates within each layer to control the persistence of data between data inputs. Some neural networks, e.g., those that are designed for time series problems or sequence-to-sequence learning, incorporate recurrent loops which permit memory, in the form of a hidden state variable, to persist within a layer between data inputs.”

In addition to obtaining background information on this patent application, NewsRx editors also obtained the inventors’ summary information for this patent application: “This specification describes technologies that relate to recurrent neural network architectures. In general, a recurrent neural network includes at least one Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layer that is compressed. The LSTM layer has at least one gate that has a compressed parameter matrix. The LSTM layer may be compressed by either replacing one or more of the gate parameter matrices in the LSTM layer with a Toeplitz-like structured matrix or by re-defining the gate parameter matrix with a compressed parameter matrix and a projection matrix. Optionally, one LSTM layer may be compressed by replacing one of the gate parameter matrices in the LSTM layer with a Toeplitz-like structured matrix and another LSTM layer may be compressed by replacing one of the gate parameter matrices in the other LSTM layer by re-defining the gate parameter matrix with a compressed parameter matrix and a projection matrix.

“For a system of one or more computers to be configured to perform particular operations or actions means that the system has installed on it software, firmware, hardware, or a combination of them that in operation cause the system to perform the operations or actions. For one or more computer programs to be configured to perform particular operations or actions means that the one or more programs include instructions that, when executed by data processing apparatus, cause the apparatus to perform the operations or actions.

“The subject matter described in this specification can be implemented in particular embodiments so as to realize one or more of the following advantages. The performance of a recurrent neural network can be improved by including a compressed LSTM layer in the recurrent neural network. In particular, by including the compressed LSTM layer in the recurrent neural network, the recurrent neural network is configured to be able to process data more efficiently and use less data storage. A recurrent neural network having a compressed LSTM layer can be effectively trained to achieve word error rates comparable to full size, e.g., uncompressed, recurrent neural networks.

3005001491,"Researchers Submit Patent Application, “Optimized Placement Of Data Contained In A Garbage Collected Storage System”, for Approval (USPTO 20200133511): Microsoft Technology Licensing LLC","2020 MAY 20 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Technology Business Daily -- From Washington, D.C., NewsRx journalists report that a patent application by the inventor MCGRATH, Michael Sean (Redmond, WA), filed on October 29, 2018, was made available online on April 30, 2020.

The patent’s assignee is Microsoft Technology Licensing LLC (Redmond, Washington, United States).

News editors obtained the following quote from the background information supplied by the inventors: “Solid state drives (SSDs), such as flash storage, offer benefits over traditional hard disk drives (HDDs). For example, SSDs are often faster, quieter, and draw less power than their HDD counterparts. However, there are also drawbacks associated with SSDs. For example, data can only be erased from the SSD in blocks, also known as ‘erase blocks.’ These erase blocks may contain, in addition to data that a user wishes to delete, stored data that the user wishes to persist on the SSD. To delete the unwanted data, the SSD performs a process known as ‘garbage collection’ to move data around on the SSD so that the persisted data is not erased. Due to physical characteristics of their storage media, SSDs only have a limited number of write-erase cycles after which a given region of SSD memory cannot be rewritten. High rates of data churn, in which new data is written to an SSD and old data is deleted can significantly contribute to SSD wear and thus increase costs for SSD users and storage solutions providers. SSDs are available that support varying amounts of write-erase cycles (referred to as ‘endurance’). SSDs with higher endurance are typically more expensive than their lower endurance counterparts and provide lower storage density.”

As a supplement to the background information on this patent application, NewsRx correspondents also obtained the inventor’s summary information for this patent application: “A garbage collection process running on a computing device is configured to track the number of garbage collection cycles that storage fragments, called extents, are persisted in storage without being modified or deleted using a lifetime counter that is implemented using metadata. At each garbage collection cycle, the extents are sorted by lifetime values. Old extents (i.e., those existing at the start of the cycle) are bucketed together by lifetime values during garbage collection into new extents (i.e., those being created during the cycle). Thus, each of the new extents includes data having similar lifetime values. The lifetime value for the new extent equals the lowest lifetime value of the old source extent plus one additional increment on the counter. As extents are organized by garbage collection lifetime, placement on storage media can be optimized according to expected endurance requirements. Thus, extents with larger lifetime values, which have persisted more garbage collection cycles, can be placed on lower endurance media as such data is stable and less likely to be modified or deleted by a device user. Extents with smaller lifetime values, which are less stable and more likely to be churned, can be placed on higher endurance media. The range of lifetime values associated with each bucket and the overall number of buckets being utilized can vary to implement differing levels of data placement granularity.

“The optimized placement of data on storage media according to endurance provides significant advantages over conventional storage management processes where garbage collection is typically performed opportunistically without consideration given to coalescing extents according to their persistence across garbage collection processes. Computing system performance is enhanced because data with similar garbage collection lifetimes are bucketed together on the storage media which can improve the efficiency of the garbage collection process. For example, by bucketing together extents that are relatively more transient (i.e., more likely to be churned), the block erases that are utilized during garbage collection are more likely to be erasing ‘dirty’ data in the bucket that is stale and no longer useful. Storage media holding extents which are relatively more stable and less transient can undergo fewer block erases since less data becomes dirty over time. Thus overall, the computing device needs to perform fewer block erases to reclaim space across the collective storage media compared with conventional garbage collection processes. In addition, cost benefits can be realized by enabling the endurance of the storage media to be well matched to their expected use. For example, less durable and lower cost types of storage media can be utilized for data that is more stable and less transient. More durable and higher cost types can be deployed in a concentrated manner for placement of transient data that is subject to higher rates of churn.

“The present optimized placement of data can also be advantageously utilized with storage systems that are implemented with a media of a single type, or that have substantially similar endurance characteristics. For example, a storage system using a single media type such as quad-level cell (QLC) NAND-based SSDs has improved computing system performance compared with conventional systems because the present garbage collection method can be performed relatively less frequently when reclaiming storage space. In addition, the efficiency of the present garbage collection method reduces wear on the storage media--fewer write-erase cycles are needed because block erases are more likely to target dirty data. For similar reasons, the present optimized placement of data can also be advantageously utilized with storage systems having magnetic storage media such as hard disk drives (HDDs) that feature shingled magnetic recording (SMR).

3005008132,"Patent Issued for Replicated Dot Maps For Simplified Depth Computation Using Machine Learning (USPTO 10,643,341): Microsoft Technology Licensing LLC","2020 MAY 20 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Computers, Networks & Communications Daily Daily -- A patent by the inventors Bleyer, Michael (Seattle, WA); Pekelny, Yuri (Seattle, WA); Price, Raymond Kirk (Redmond, WA), filed on March 22, 2018, was published online on May 18, 2020, according to news reporting originating from Alexandria, Virginia, by NewsRx correspondents.

Patent number 10,643,341 is assigned to Microsoft Technology Licensing LLC (Redmond, Washington, United States).

The following quote was obtained by the news editors from the background information supplied by the inventors: “Mixed-reality systems, including virtual-reality and augmented-reality systems, have received significant attention because of their ability to create truly unique experiences for their users. For reference, conventional virtual-reality (VR) systems create a completely immersive experience by restricting their users’ views to only a virtual environment. This is often achieved through the use of a head-mounted device (HMD) that completely blocks any view of the real world. As a result, a user is entirely immersed within the virtual environment. In contrast, conventional augmented-reality (AR) systems create an augmented-reality experience by visually presenting virtual objects that are placed in or that interact with the real world.

“As used herein, VR and AR systems are described and referenced interchangeably. Unless stated otherwise, the descriptions herein apply equally to all types of mixed-reality systems, which (as detailed above) includes AR systems, VR reality systems, and/or any other similar system capable of displaying virtual objects.

“The disclosed mixed-reality systems use one or more on-body devices (e.g., the HMD, a handheld device, etc.). The HMD provides a display that enables a user to view overlapping and/or integrated visual information in whatever environment the user is in, be it a VR environment or an AR environment. By way of example, as shown in FIG. 1, a mixed-reality system may present virtual content to a user in the form of a simulated vase resting on a real table surface.

“Continued advances in hardware capabilities and rendering technologies have greatly improved how mixed-reality systems render virtual objects. However, the process of immersing a user into a mixed-reality environment creates many challenges, difficulties, and costs, particularly with regard to determining three-dimensional spatial information around the user and tracking a user’s movement so the visual display of information can be correctly presented to the user.

“For instance, by way of example, conventional passive stereo depth detection systems fail to adequately determine the depth of a smooth or low texture surface (e.g., a wall) in a mixed-reality environment because those systems fail to adequately distinguish one part of the smooth/textureless surface from another part. As such, there is a substantial need to improve how depth is detected, especially for smooth/textureless surfaced objects in mixed-reality environments.

“The subject matter claimed herein is not limited to embodiments that solve any disadvantages or that operate only in environments such as those described above. Rather, this background is only provided to illustrate one exemplary technology area where some embodiments described herein may be practiced.”

In addition to the background information obtained for this patent, NewsRx journalists also obtained the inventors’ summary information for this patent: “Disclosed embodiments include methods and systems for utilizing a structured projection pattern to perform depth detection. In some instances, the structured projection pattern forms a dot pattern, which is projected by an infrared (IR) illuminator, wherein the dot pattern includes a replicated sub-pattern having a predefined height and width. The sub-pattern is replicated in at least one direction such that the dot pattern comprises a plurality of replicated sub-patterns that are adjacently positioned.

“In some embodiments, the IR illuminator projects the structured projection pattern into an environment with one or more objects within the field of view of a camera system. The structured projection pattern is reflected off of the object(s), and the camera system obtains at least one image of the reflected structured projection pattern. Finally, the system utilizes the image(s) to perform depth detection.

“In certain embodiments, the system performs depth detection through a stereo matching approach, by determining matches in pixel patches between corresponding scanlines of two captured images to calculate disparity and corresponding relative depth. In other embodiments, the system performs depth detection through a structured light approach, by determining matches in pixel patches between a captured image and a virtual image to calculate the disparity and corresponding depth.

“This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used as an aid in determining the scope of the claimed subject matter.

“Additional features and advantages will be set forth in the description which follows, and in part will be obvious from the description, or may be learned by the practice of the teachings herein. Features and advantages of the invention may be realized and obtained by means of the instruments and combinations particularly pointed out in the appended claims.

3005002139,Patent Application Titled “Smooth Draping Layer For Rendering Vector Data On Complex Three Dimensional Objects” Published Online (USPTO 20200134903): Google LLC,"2020 MAY 20 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Internet Daily News -- According to news reporting originating from Washington, D.C., by NewsRx journalists, a patent application by the inventors Overbeck, Ryan Styles (San Francisco, CA); Kontkanen, Janne (San Francisco, CA), filed on December 20, 2019, was made available online on April 30, 2020.

The assignee for this patent application is Google LLC (Mountain View, California, United States).

Reporters obtained the following quote from the background information supplied by the inventors: “Improvements in computer processing power and broadband technology have led to the development of interactive three-dimensional models. For instance, interactive geographic information systems can provide for the navigating and displaying of three-dimensional representations of geographic areas. A user can navigate the three-dimensional representation by controlling a virtual camera that specifies what portion of the three-dimensional representation is rendered and presented to a user.

“The three-dimensional model can include geometry and texture that is texture mapped to the geometry. For instance, a three dimensional model of a geographic area can include terrain geometry that models the terrain of the Earth in addition to building geometry that models buildings, bridges, and other objects. Geographic imagery, such as aerial or satellite imagery, and other imagery can be texture mapped to the terrain geometry and/or the building geometry to provide a more realistic model of the geographic area.

“Vector data can be rendered in conjunction with the three dimensional model. Vector data can include data such as labels, overlays, road overlays, text, and other data. One approach to rendering vector data in conjunction with the three-dimensional model is to render the vector data in the three-dimensional space defined by the model. This can require complex projection calculations and can require tracing many rays to place the vector data correctly relative to the surface of the three-dimensional model. It can also be difficult to consistently place the vector data correctly using this approach.

“Another approach to rendering vector data in conjunction with the three-dimensional model is to texture map the vector data to the three-dimensional model. However, certain objects within the three-dimensional model can include lumpy, edgy and awkward geometry. As a result, texture mapping vector data directly to the three-dimensional model can lead to the vector data becoming unreadable or placed incorrectly.”

In addition to obtaining background information on this patent application, NewsRx editors also obtained the inventors’ summary information for this patent application: “Aspects and advantages of the invention will be set forth in part in the following description, or may be obvious from the description, or may be learned through practice of the invention.

“One exemplary aspect of the present disclosure is directed to a computer-implemented method of rendering vector data in conjunction with a three-dimensional model. The method includes presenting a viewport in a user interface on a display device and rendering a three-dimensional model in the viewport. The method further includes rendering a transparent draping layer overlaying the three-dimensional model and texture mapping the vector data to the transparent draping layer such that the vector data appears to be located along a surface of the three-dimensional model in the viewport.

“Other exemplary aspects of the present disclosure are directed to systems, apparatus, non-transitory computer-readable media, user interfaces and devices for rendering vector data in conjunction with a three-dimensional model, such as a three-dimensional model of a geographic area.

“These and other features, aspects and advantages of the present invention will become better understood with reference to the following description and appended claims.

3005002215,Patent Application Titled “Probabilistic Techniques For Formatting Digital Components” Published Online (USPTO 20200133670): Google LLC,"2020 MAY 20 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Internet Daily News -- According to news reporting originating from Washington, D.C., by NewsRx journalists, a patent application by the inventors Jain, Ankur (Redwood City, CA); Muralidharan, Omkar (Sunnyvale, CA); Morar, Pavel (Mountain View, CA), filed on January 22, 2019, was made available online on April 30, 2020.

The assignee for this patent application is Google LLC (Mountain View, California, United States).

Reporters obtained the following quote from the background information supplied by the inventors: “The Internet provides access to a wide variety of resources. For example, video and/or audio files, as well as web pages for particular subjects or particular news articles are accessible over the Internet. The resources can present content related to the particular subjects or particular news articles. Digital components can be presented with the content of the resources. Some digital components can be reformatted, e.g., by adding extensions to the digital components. However, some digital components may not be eligible to be reformatted using some extensions.”

In addition to obtaining background information on this patent application, NewsRx editors also obtained the inventors’ summary information for this patent application: “This specification describes technologies relating to using probabilistic techniques to reformat digital components such that particular formats of the digital component that would not otherwise be provided are provided a portion of the times that the digital component is provided for presentation.

“In general, one innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in systems that include one or more front-end servers configured to receive requests for digital components and provide digital components in response to the requests and one or more back-end servers in data communication with the one or more front-end servers. The one or more back-end servers can be configured to perform operations that include obtaining data specifying a distribution parameter limit for a given reformattable digital component that is eligible for reformatting using a set of digital component extensions. Each digital component extension can include additional content that, when selected, is used to generate a reformatted version of the given reformattable digital component. For each of multiple digital component requests for which the given reformattable digital component is selected for distribution to a client device in response to the digital component request, the back-end server(s) can determine that a given digital component extension in the set of the digital component extensions has an additional selection requirement that, when combined with a base selection requirement for the given reformattable digital component, would exceed the distribution parameter limit for the given reformattable digital component. The base selection requirement is an amount required to be submitted to digital component distributor to provide a base version of the digital component without an extension. The back-end server(s) can determine, using a probabilistic technique and based at least on the distribution parameter limit and the base selection requirement, a probability at which the given digital component extension will be selected for use in generating a reformatted version of the given reformattable digital component such that an aggregate selection requirement for distributing the given reformattable digital component in response to a plurality of requests over time is within the distribution parameter limit. The back-end server(s) can select a digital component extension for the given reformattable digital component. The given digital component extension for which a combination of the base selection requirement and the additional selection requirement exceeds the distribution parameter limit is selected for a portion of the digital component requests according to the determined probability. The back-end server(s) can generate a reformatted version of the given reformattable digital component using the selected digital component extension. The back-end server(s) can provide the reformatted version of the given reformattable digital component to the front-end server(s). The front-end server(s) can transmit the reformatted version of the given digital component to the client device for which the digital component request was received. Other implementations of this aspect include corresponding apparatus, methods, and computer programs, configured to perform the aspects of the methods, encoded on computer storage devices.

“These and other implementations can each optionally include one or more of the following features. In some aspects, the operations include determining, using the probabilistic technique, a second probability at which a second digital component extension will be selected for use in generating a second reformatted version of the given reformattable digital component. A combination of the base selection requirement and a second additional selection requirement for the second digital component extensions can be less than the distribution parameter limit.

“In some aspects, the operations include selecting the given digital component extension and the second digital component extension from the set of digital component extensions based on (i) the combination of the base selection requirement and the additional selection requirement and (ii) the combination of the base selection requirement and the second additional selection requirement. Selecting the given digital component extension and the second digital component extension from the set of digital component extensions can include determining that a first combined selection requirement that is based on the combination of the base selection requirement and the additional selection requirement is a lowest combined selection requirement for the set of digital component extensions that is higher than the distribution parameter limit and, in response, selecting the given digital component extension and determining that a second combined selection requirement that is based on the combination of the base selection requirement and a second additional selection requirement is a highest combined selection requirement for the set of digital component extensions that is less than the distribution parameter limit and, in response, selecting the second digital component extension.

“In some aspects, the operations include determining, using the probabilistic technique, a second probability at which the given reformattable digital component will be provided without reformatting using a digital component extension.

“In some aspects, the operations include determining, for each or two or more second digital component extensions, a respective second probability at which the second digital component extension will be selected for use in generating a second reformatted version of the given reformattable digital component. The probability at which the given digital component extension will be selected and each second probability can be determined such that the aggregate selection requirement for distributing the given reformattable digital component using the given digital component extension and each of the second digital component extensions is within the distribution parameter limit.

“Determining the probability at which the given digital component will be selected for use in generating the reformatted version of the given reformattable digital component can include determining the probability based on an expected increase in user interactions with the reformattable digital component by including the given digital component extension in the reformatted version of the reformattable digital component.

“In some aspects, the base selection requirement for the given reformattable digital component is based on a combination of the distribution parameter limit and a performance of the reformattable digital component.

“The subject matter described in this specification can be implemented in particular embodiments so as to realize one or more of the following advantages. Using probabilistic techniques described herein, formats of digital components that would otherwise not be provided based on their associated selection requirements are provided at a specified rate such that a distribution parameter limit for the digital component is not exceeded. Selecting extensions for use in reformatting digital components using specified probabilities allows digital components to be reformatted using multiple extensions such that the aggregate selection requirements for distributed formats of the digital components is equal to or close to (e.g., within a threshold of) the distribution parameter limit for the digital component.

“Using the unconventional digital component distribution techniques described herein, the user experience is improved relative to conventional techniques as users are provided digital components in formats that have higher user interaction rates and are thus preferred by users. In addition, users are provided more interactive digital components that initiate actions for the users as conventionally these formats of digital components often have selection requirements that exceed distribution parameter limits for the digital components. Digital component distributors are benefitted by higher interaction rates due to the digital components being provided in formats that have higher user interaction rates.

“Various features and advantages of the foregoing subject matter is described below with respect to the figures. Additional features and advantages are apparent from the subject matter described herein and the claims.”

3005002326,Patent Application Titled “Adaptive Natural Language Steganography And Watermarking For Virtual Assistants” Published Online (USPTO 20200134022): Google LLC,"2020 MAY 20 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Internet Daily News -- According to news reporting originating from Washington, D.C., by NewsRx journalists, a patent application by the inventors Millius, Sebastian (Zurich, CH); Feuz, Sandro (Zurich, CH), filed on October 24, 2019, was made available online on April 30, 2020.

The assignee for this patent application is Google LLC (Mountain View, California, United States).

Reporters obtained the following quote from the background information supplied by the inventors: “This specification relates to natural language processing to detect fully automated conversations.

“A virtual assistant, or a chatbot, is an application that understands natural language voice commands and completes tasks for a user that requires communication with another participant. In order to complete these tasks, the virtual assistant can be programmed to perform natural language conversations, e.g., make phone calls or engage in text message or chat conversations, on behalf of users.”

In addition to obtaining background information on this patent application, NewsRx editors also obtained the inventors’ summary information for this patent application: “This specification describes technologies for detecting fully-automated conversations using adaptive natural language steganography and watermarking. These technologies generally involve an interactive protocol to surreptitiously announce and detect that both participants in a conversation are automated without a human user being able to determine that detection is taking place. After detecting that both sides of the conversation are automated, an example automation detection system changes the communication method of the conversation to an efficient communication method for automated communication participants.

“In general, one innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in methods that include the actions of initiating, over a natural language communication channel, a conversation with a communication participant using a natural language communication method that includes a dialogue of natural language communications, determining that the communication participant is automated using a pre-defined adaptive interactive protocol that specifies a plurality of natural language linguistic transformations for the dialogue of natural language communications, and in response to determining that the communication participant is automated, transitioning the conversation to a communication method that is different from the natural language communication method with which the conversation was initiated.

“Other embodiments of this aspect include corresponding computer systems, apparatus, computer program products (software products), and computer programs recorded on one or more computer storage devices, each configured to perform the actions of the methods. For a system of one or more computers to be configured to perform particular operations or actions means that the system has installed on it software, firmware, hardware, or a combination of them that in operation cause the system to perform the operations or actions. For one or more computer programs to be configured to perform particular operations or actions means that the one or more programs include instructions that, when executed by data processing apparatus, cause the apparatus to perform the operations or actions.

“The foregoing and other embodiments can each optionally include one or more of the following features, alone or in combination. In particular, one embodiment includes all the following features in combination.

“The subject matter described in this specification can be implemented in particular embodiments so as to realize one or more of the following advantages.

“An example automation detection system provides an interactive watermarking and steganography protocol to announce and detect automated conversations. Subtle audio marking for the purpose of automation detection is hard and expensive to do since most conversations with automated systems, e.g., virtual assistants, are over text, either directly by the user entering text, or using text generated by speech-to-text conversion. In the case that user speech is recorded using microphone(s), data used to generate the audio marking may be masked by noise picked up by the microphones at a lower sampling rate. For that reason, the present system performs automated detection using a surreptitious adaptive interactive protocol that ensures that human-machine interaction quality does not suffer. In fact, the system subtly determines whether the other side of a conversation is an automated device, e.g., virtual assistant, using images, audio, or text, without making the conversation awkward for human interactors.

“For virtual assistants or bots, communicating over natural language or natural language text is sub-optimal and less efficient than communicating over a machine communication protocol. Furthermore, natural language communication is error-prone since automated systems can misinterpret or misunderstand natural language when performing natural language processing.

“Therefore, once the system detects automated conversation, the system can switch the automated conversation to a communication protocol that is more efficient than natural language. Additionally, by knowing that both participants are bots, the system can perform different tasks that automated virtual assistants can easily perform, but the system would not attempt if either communication participant was a human. For instance, when verifying authenticity of a caller if both communication participants are automated from a same system, the virtual assistants may be able to verify a shared secret, e.g., a public or private key. If the communication has a human participant, the human participant could not be expected to read out and be able to verify a user’s public key.

“The system is further advantageous because it uses a natural-text based approach that is easy to plug into existing systems and can work with a variety of text-to-speech systems since it is system-independent.

“The system is further advantageous because it may be robust to noise or signal degradation in the natural communication channel (for example, due to inadvertent signal pick-up from other communication channels). For example, unlike a conventional stenography system which encodes data in a certain inaudible frequency range, and is therefore susceptible to noise in that range, encoding data by means of transformed natural language communications will not be degraded provided that channel transmits the transformed natural language communications sufficiently accurately for them to be comprehensible. Thus, the present system exploits the power of known chatbot systems to overcome the limitations of natural communication channels.

“An alternative expression of the disclosure is a method for automated conversation detection between a plurality of communication participants, the method comprising one of the communication participants initiating, over a natural language communication channel, a conversation with another of the communication participants using a natural language communication method that includes a dialogue of natural language communications, a first of the communication participants at least once generating a natural language communication of the dialogue, transforming the natural language communication based a pre-defined adaptive interactive protocol that specifies a plurality of natural language linguistic transformations, and transmitting the transformed natural language communication over the natural language communication channel, and another of the communication participants receiving one or more said transformed natural language communications over the natural language communication channel, determining from the one or more said transformed natural language communications using the pre-defined adaptive interactive protocol that the first communication participant is automated, and in response to determining that the communication participant is automated, transitioning the conversation to a communication method that is different from the natural language communication method with which the conversation was initiated.

“Each of the communication participants, in the case that it is automated, may be operative both to generate and transmit transformed natural language communications, and to determine from received natural language communication(s) that another communication participant is automated and transition the conversation. However, in principle, one of the communication participants may be operative to generate and transmit transformed natural language communications but not necessarily to perform the determination that the other communication participant is automated or to transition the conversation; while a second of the communication participants may be operative to determine that another communication participant is automated and to transition the conversation, but not necessarily to generate and transmit transformed natural language communications.

“Thus, another expression of the disclosure is a method performed by an automated communication participant in a natural language dialogue over a natural language communication channel, comprising at least once generating a natural language communication of the natural language dialogue, transforming the natural language communication based a pre-defined adaptive interactive protocol that specifies a plurality of natural language linguistic transformations, and transmitting the transformed natural language communication over the natural language communication channel.

“A further expression of the disclosure is a method performed by a first automated communication participant in a natural language dialogue with a second communication participant by a natural language communication method and over a natural language communication channel, comprising receiving one or more said natural language communications of the dialogue from the second communication participant over the natural language communication channel, comparing said received natural language communications to a pre-defined adaptive interactive protocol, and thereby determining that the second communication participant is automated, and in response to determining that the second communication participant is automated, transitioning the conversation to a communication method that is different from the natural language communication method.

“The expression ‘natural language communication method’ means a communication method using a human language, composed of individual communications which are consistent with the rules of the human language. Examples of natural language communication methods include text and spoken communication methods. The expression ‘natural language linguistic transformation’ means a transformation which transforms a first natural language communication into a second natural language communication, such that the two natural language communications are different, but both are consistent with the same natural language communication method (i.e. conform to the rules of the same human language) and both contain the same information about the subject of the dialogue.

“The details of one or more embodiments of the subject matter of this specification are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features, aspects, and advantages of the subject matter will become apparent from the description, the drawings, and the claims.”

3005002230,"Patent Issued for System And Method For Generating A Geographic Information Card Map (USPTO 10,642,883): Google Inc.","2020 MAY 20 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Internet Daily News -- A patent by the inventors Bailiang, Zhou (Mountain View, CA); Zhang, Guangqiang (Mountain View, CA), filed on June 27, 2016, was published online on May 18, 2020, according to news reporting originating from Alexandria, Virginia, by NewsRx correspondents.

Patent number 10,642,883 is assigned to Google Inc. (Mountain View, California, United States).

The following quote was obtained by the news editors from the background information supplied by the inventors: “Today, digital maps of geographic areas are displayed on computing devices, such as computers, tablets, and mobile phones via map applications, web browsers, etc. Many map applications display map tiles which are equally sized portions of a geographic area that include map features, such as states, cities, roads, streets, rivers, mountains, etc., and/or map labels. The user may select among several scales for viewing the map. When the user increases the scale, the geographic area may be divided into a larger number of map tiles which display the map features at a higher level of detail.

“Additionally, qualitative information for places is commonly displayed on computing devices, such as computers, tablets, and mobile phones via map applications, web browsers, etc. in displays separate from the map view. For example, reviews of points of interest (POIs) or photographs of a POI may be displayed.”

In addition to the background information obtained for this patent, NewsRx journalists also obtained the inventors’ summary information for this patent: “To provide synergy between spatial and qualitative information in a single display, a card map application on a client computing device displays a schematic representation of geographic entities. The schematic representation includes qualitative information about each geographic entity, where the geographic entities are organized spatially. For example, each of the U.S. states may be displayed on an individual geographic information card, which includes such information as photographs of the state, a description of the state, reviews of POIs in the state, a map view of the state, etc. The geographic information cards may be displayed side-by-side, above, and below each other in a grid pattern to define a ‘card map,’ where the geographic information card for each state is positioned according to the state’s location in relation to the other states. For example, the geographic information card for California may be displayed to the left of the geographic information card for Nevada and below the geographic information card for Oregon on a card map display.

“Rather than dividing a geographic area (e.g., the United States) into map tiles which represent equally sized portions of the geographic area, or otherwise generating a digital map that accurately represents distances, sizes, and other geographic properties, the card map application generates the geographic information cards according to political boundaries, population, popularity, information density, etc. In this manner, a user may view portions of the geographic area which are recognizable and likely to be significant to the user. For example, if the information density in portions of Nevada is low, such as locations between Reno and Las Vegas, the card map application may not generate geographic information cards for such locations. As a result, the user does not have to navigate through several geographic information cards between Reno and Las Vegas on the card map display, and also may learn that a big city does not exist between the two locations when planning a trip, for example. Further, the present embodiments advantageously allow users to view spatially organized information along with qualitative information for places. In this manner, users do not have to navigate back and forth between multiple views (e.g., a map view and a review page) when researching a particular place.

“In particular, an example embodiment of the techniques of the present disclosure is a method for presenting geographic data on a client computing device. The method includes generating geographic information cards for respective geographic entities, where at least two of the geographic information cards of an equal size correspond to geographic areas of different sizes or geometries. The method further includes generating a representation of a geographic area using the geographic information cards, including placing each geographic information card relative to the rest of the geographic information cards in accordance with relative geographic positioning of the corresponding geographic entities. Moreover, the method includes providing the representation of the geographic area via a user interface of the client computing device, where at least some of the geographic information cards are individually selectable to display additional information related to the corresponding geographic entities.

“Another example embodiment is a client computing device for presenting geographic data, where the client computing device includes a user interface, one or more processors coupled to the user interface, and a non-transitory computer-readable memory coupled to the one or more processors and storing thereon instructions. The instructions, when executed by the one or more processors, cause the client computing device to generate geographic information cards for respective geographic entities, where at least two of the geographic information cards of an equal size correspond to geographic areas of different sizes or geometries, and generate a representation of a geographic area using the geographic information cards, including placing each geographic information card relative to the rest of the geographic information cards in accordance with relative geographic positioning of the corresponding geographic entities. The instructions further cause the client computing device to provide the representation of the geographic area via the user interface of the client computing device, where at least some of the geographic information cards are individually selectable to display additional information related to the corresponding geographic entities.

“Yet another example embodiment is a server device for presenting geographic data, where the server device includes one or more processors and a non-transitory computer-readable memory coupled to the one or more processors and storing thereon instructions. For each of a plurality of levels of detail, the instructions, when executed by the one or more processors, cause the server device to divide a geographic area into a plurality of regions each representing a different geographic entity, where at each higher level of detail the geographic area is divided into more regions, and where at least two regions at a same level of detail correspond to geographic entities having different sizes or geometries. For each region, the instructions cause the server device to retrieve indications of geographic information data for the region and in response to receiving a request from a client computing device for the geographic information data for a geographic area, the instructions cause the server device to identify one or more regions corresponding to the geographic area. The instructions further cause the client computing device to provide the indications of the geographic information data for the one or more identified regions to the client computing device for displaying geographic information cards for the geographic area.”

3005002336,"Researchers Submit Patent Application, “Generating Media Content Playlists Including Relevant Interstitials”, for Approval (USPTO 20200133973): Google LLC","2020 MAY 20 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Internet Daily News -- From Washington, D.C., NewsRx journalists report that a patent application by the inventors Justin, LEWIS (Marina del Rey, CA); KASINA, Abhiram (San Bruno, CA), filed on March 20, 2018, was made available online on April 30, 2020.

The patent’s assignee is Google LLC (Mountain View, California, United States).

News editors obtained the following quote from the background information supplied by the inventors: “Audio and video content can be stored on data servers and provided to users for listening/viewing over the Internet. Many social media platforms include a content sharing aspect that allows users to upload, view, and share content, such as video content, image content, audio content, text content, and so on (which may be collectively referred to as ‘media content items’). Such media content items may include audio clips, movie clips, TV clips, and music videos, as well as amateur content such as video blogging, short original videos, pictures, photos, other multimedia content, etc. Applications for supporting the listening/viewing of such media content items may be browser-based, or may run independently of a browser in a standalone application.”

As a supplement to the background information on this patent application, NewsRx correspondents also obtained the inventors’ summary information for this patent application: “The following presents a simplified summary of various aspects of this disclosure in order to provide a basic understanding of such aspects. This summary is not an extensive overview of all contemplated aspects, and is intended to neither identify key or critical elements nor delineate the scope of such aspects. Its purpose is to present some concepts of this disclosure in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is presented later.

“In some aspects of the disclosure, interstitials may be provided in playlists that are relevant to surrounding media content items. In some embodiments, the interstitials that are selected to be inserted in the playlist may be related to both a first media content item and a second media content item (e.g., a pair of media content items). For example, the interstitial may be a trivia tidbit that provides information about the pair of media content items (e.g., a singer in the first song went on to form the band playing a second song in the pair). Also, an optimization technique can be used to order a set of media content items such that these interstitial intersections occur as frequently as possible. Providing relevant interstitials with the media content items may facilitate cohesiveness of content across the playlist and provide a more enjoyable user experience. As a result, user retention may be achieved. Also, computing resources may be reduced by selecting relevant interstitials, as described further below.

“According to one aspect of the present disclosure there is provided a method comprising: identifying a plurality of media content items for a playlist; identifying a plurality of interstitials for the playlist; pairing the plurality of media content items based on the plurality of interstitials, wherein each resulting pair of media content items is related to one of the plurality of interstitials; and arranging the resulting pairs of media content items in the playlist together with the interstitials that are each related to both media content items in a respective pair of the resulting pairs, wherein each interstitial is inserted between a first media content item and a second media content item in a respective pair of the resulting pairs in the playlist.

“The pairing step may pair the plurality of media content items into resulting pairs of media content items. Furthermore, the pairing of the plurality of media content items may be implemented such that each resulting pair of media content items has one or more identifiers that match one or more identifiers of one of the plurality of interstitials.

“Content of each interstitial may provide a transition from the first media content item in the respective pair of the resulting pairs to the second media content item in the respective pair of the resulting pairs, to facilitate cohesiveness of content across the playlist.

“The resulting pairs of media content items and the interstitials may be arranged in the playlist based on a score of a frequency of occurrence of pairs of media content items having one or more identifiers that match one or more identifiers of one of the plurality of interstitials.

“Arranging the resulting pairs of media content items in the playlist together with the interstitials may comprise traversing a longest path of nodes on a graph, wherein the nodes on the graph comprise each media content item in the resulting pairs of media content items and each interstitial, and the media content items in the resulting pairs of media content items are linked together by the respective interstitial having the one or more identifiers that match the one or more identifiers of the resulting pair of media content items.

3005002155,"Patent Issued for Deep Machine Learning Methods And Apparatus For Robotic Grasping (USPTO 10,639,792): Google LLC","2020 MAY 20 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Internet Daily News -- Google LLC (Mountain View, California, United States) has been issued patent number 10,639,792, according to news reporting originating out of Alexandria, Virginia, by NewsRx editors.

The patent’s inventors are Vijayanarasimhan, Sudheendra (Pasadena, CA); Jang, Eric (Cupertino, CA); Pastor Sampedro, Peter (Oakland, CA); Levine, Sergey (Berkeley, CA).

This patent was filed on January 26, 2018 and was published online on May 18, 2020.

From the background information supplied by the inventors, news correspondents obtained the following quote: “Many robots are programmed to utilize one or more end effectors to grasp one or more objects. For example, a robot may utilize a grasping end effector such as an ‘impactive’ gripper or ‘ingressive’ gripper (e.g., physically penetrating an object using pins, needles, etc.) to pick up an object from a first location, move the object to a second location, and drop off the object at the second location. Some additional examples of robot end effectors that may grasp objects include ‘astrictive’ end effectors (e.g., using suction or vacuum to pick up an object) and one or more ‘contigutive’ end effectors (e.g., using surface tension, freezing or adhesive to pick up an object), to name just a few.”

Supplementing the background information on this patent, NewsRx reporters also obtained the inventors’ summary information for this patent: “This specification is directed generally to deep machine learning methods and apparatus related to manipulation of an object by an end effector of a robot. Some implementations are directed to training a grasp deep neural network, such as a convolutional neural network (also referred to herein as a ‘CNN’), to predict the probability that candidate motion data for an end effector of a robot will result in a successful grasp of one or more objects by the end effector and/or to predict spatial transformation parameters for a spatial transformer network (also referred to herein as a ‘STN’). For example, some implementations enable applying, as input to a trained grasp deep neural network, at least: (1) a candidate motion vector that defines a candidate motion (if any) of a grasping end effector of a robot and (2) an image that captures at least a portion of the work space of the robot; and generating, based on the applying: (1) a measure that directly or indirectly indicates the probability that the candidate motion vector will result in a successful grasp; and/or (2) spatial transformation parameters that indicate a location in the image (or an additional image) toward which the grasping end effector will move. The measure indicating the probability and/or the spatial transformation parameters may then be used in servoing performance of grasp attempts by a robot having a grasping end effector, thereby improving the ability of the robot to successfully grasp objects in its environment.

“Some of those implementations are further directed to training a spatial transformer network to generate a spatial transformation of an image based on received spatial transformation parameters and/or to training a semantic deep neural network (e.g., semantic CNN) to predict, based on the spatial transformation, a class (and/or other semantic feature(s)) of an object in the spatial transformation. In some versions of those implementations, the semantic deep neural network may be trained based on both: training examples generated based on grasp attempts by one or more robots; and training examples from other computer vision datasets that include training examples not generated based on grasp attempts by one or more robots (e.g., training examples from the IMAGENET image database). Using training examples from other computer vision datasets may increase the accuracy and/or breadth of semantic understanding of the semantic deep neural network.

“Some implementations are directed to utilization of the trained grasp deep neural network, the trained spatial transformer network, and/or the trained semantic deep neural network to servo a grasping end effector of a robot to achieve a successful grasp, of an object having desired semantic object features, by the grasping end effector. For example, the various trained networks may be utilized in the iterative updating of motion control commands for one or more actuators of a robot that control the pose of a grasping end effector of the robot, and to determine when to generate grasping control commands to effectuate an attempted grasp by the grasping end effector. For instance, grasping control commands may only be generated and provided to corresponding actuators when output generated over the grasping deep neural network indicates that a likelihood of successful grasp satisfies a threshold and when output generated over the semantic deep neural network indicates that the grasp will likely be of an object having desired semantic object feature(s).

“Using trained network(s) to achieve a successful grasp of an object having desired semantic object features may enable a robot to perform various actions directed to objects having particular object feature(s), where those particular object feature(s) are dictated by human generated user interface input and/or by another component (e.g., a higher level task planner). For example, a user may provide user interface input (e.g., spoken, typed) that indicates a desire to grasp an object having one or more particular object feature(s) and the robot may utilize the trained networks to attempt a grasp only when: the grasp is likely to be successful and is likely to be of an object having the particular object feature(s). For instance, the user may provide user interface input of ‘pick up the spoon’ and the robot may attempt a grasp based on output generated over the grasp deep neural network indicating a grasp is likely to be successful and based on output generated over the semantic deep neural network indicating the grasp is likely to be of an object having a classification of ‘spoon’.

“In some implementations, a method is provided that includes: generating a candidate end effector motion vector defining motion to move a grasping end effector of a robot from a current pose to an additional pose; and identifying a current image captured by a vision sensor associated with the robot. The current image captures the grasping end effector and at least one object in an environment of the robot. The method further includes: applying the current image and the candidate end effector motion vector as input to a trained grasp convolutional neural network; generating, over the trained grasp convolutional neural network, a measure of successful grasp of the object with application of the motion. The measure is generated based on the application of the image and the end effector motion vector to the trained grasp convolutional neural network. The method further includes identifying a desired object semantic feature; applying, as input to a semantic convolutional neural network, a spatial transformation of the current image or of an additional image captured by the vision sensor; and generating, over the semantic convolutional neural network based on the spatial transformation, an additional measure that indicates whether the desired object semantic feature is present in the spatial transformation. The method further includes generating an end effector command based on the measure of successful grasp and the additional measure that indicates whether the desired object semantic feature is present; and providing the end effector command to one or more actuators of the robot.

“These and other implementations may include on or more of the following features.

“In some implementations, the method further includes: generating, over the trained grasp convolutional neural network based on the application of the image and the end effector motion vector to the trained grasp convolutional neural network, spatial transformation parameters; and generating the spatial transformation over a spatial transformation network based on the spatial transformation parameters.

“In some implementations, the desired object semantic feature defines an object classification.

“In some implementations, the method further includes receiving user interface input from a user interface input device and identifying the desired object semantic feature based on the user interface input. In some of those implementations, the user interface input device is a microphone, such as a microphone of the robot.

“In some implementations, the spatial transformation is of the current image, such as a spatial transformation that crops out a portion of the current image.

“In some implementations, the method further includes: determining a current measure of successful grasp of the object without application of the motion. In some of those implementations, generating the end effector command based on the measure includes generating the end effector command based on comparison of the measure to the current measure. In some versions of those implementations, the end effector command is a grasp command and generating the grasp command is in response to: determining that the additional measure indicates that the desired object feature is present in the spatial transformation; and determining that comparison of the measure to the current measure satisfies one or more criteria.

“In some implementations, the end effector command is an end effector motion command and generating the end effector motion command includes generating the end effector motion command to conform to the candidate end effector motion vector.

“In some implementations, the end effector command is an end effector motion command and conforms to the candidate end effector motion vector. In some of those implementations, providing the end effector motion command to the one or more actuators moves the end effector to a new pose, and the method further includes: generating an additional candidate end effector motion vector defining new motion to move the grasping end effector from the new pose to a further additional pose; identifying a new image captured by a vision sensor associated with the robot, the new image capturing the end effector at the new pose and capturing the objects in the environment; applying the new image and the additional candidate end effector motion vector as input to the trained grasp convolutional neural network; generating, over the trained grasp convolutional neural network, a new measure of successful grasp of the object with application of the new motion, the new measure being generated based on the application of the new image and the additional end effector motion vector to the trained grasp convolutional neural network; applying, as input to the semantic convolutional neural network, an additional spatial transformation of the new image or a new additional image captured by the vision sensor; generating, over the semantic convolutional neural network based on the additional spatial transformation, a new additional measure that indicates whether the desired object feature is present in the spatial transformation; generating a new end effector command based on the new measure of successful grasp and the new additional measure that indicates whether the desired object feature is present; and providing the new end effector command to one or more actuators of the robot.

“In some implementations, applying the image and the candidate end effector motion vector as input to the trained grasp convolutional neural network includes: applying the image as input to an initial layer of the trained grasp convolutional neural network; and applying the candidate end effector motion vector to an additional layer of the trained grasp convolutional neural network. The additional layer can be downstream of the initial layer.

The method further includes: generating, over a spatial transformer network, a spatial transformation based on the spatial transformation parameters. The spatial transformation is of the current image or an additional image captured by the vision sensor. The method further includes: applying the spatial transformation as input to a semantic convolutional neural network; generating, over the semantic convolutional neural network based on the spatial transformation, an additional measure that indicates whether a desired object semantic feature is present in the spatial transformation; generating an end effector command based on the measure and the additional measure; and providing the end effector command to one or more actuators of the robot.

“In some implementations, a method is provided that includes: identifying a current image captured by a vision sensor of a robot; and generating, over a portion of a semantic grasping model based on application of the current image to the portion: a measure of successful grasp, by a grasping end effector of the robot, of an object captured in the current image; and spatial transformation parameters. The method further includes: generating a spatial transformation of the current image based on the spatial transformation parameters; applying the spatial transformation as input to an additional portion of the semantic grasping model; generating, over the additional portion based on the spatial transformation, an additional measure that indicates whether a desired object semantic feature is present in the spatial transformation; generating an end effector command based on the measure and the additional measure; and providing the end effector command.

“In some implementations, a method is provided that includes identifying a plurality of training examples generated based on sensor output from one or more robots during a plurality of grasp attempts by the robots. Each of the training examples includes training example input that includes: an image for a corresponding instance of time of a corresponding grasp attempt of the grasp attempts, the image capturing a robotic end effector and one or more environmental objects at the corresponding instance of time; and an end effector motion vector defining motion of the end effector to move from an instance of time pose of the end effector at the corresponding instance of time to a final pose of the end effector for the corresponding grasp attempt. Each of the training examples further include training example output that includes: at least one grasped object label indicating a semantic feature of an object grasped by the corresponding grasp attempt. The method further includes training, by one or more of the processors, a semantic convolutional neural network based on the training examples.

“These and other implementations may include on or more of the following features.

“In some implementations, training the semantic convolutional neural network based on the training examples includes: applying, to a grasp convolutional neural network, the training example input of a given training example of the training examples; generating, over the grasp convolutional neural network based on the training example input of the given training example, spatial transformer network parameters; using the spatial transformer network parameters to generate a spatial transformation of the image of the given training example; generating output over the semantic convolutional neural network based on the spatial transformation image; and performing backpropagation on the semantic convolutional neural network based on the output and the training example output of the given training example. In some of those implementations, the method further includes training the semantic convolutional neural network based on additional training examples that are not generated based on grasp attempts. In some of those implementations, applying the training example input of the given training example to the grasp convolutional neural network includes: applying the image of the given training example as input to an initial layer of the grasp convolutional neural network; and applying the end effector motion vector of the given training example to an additional layer of the grasp convolutional neural network that is downstream of the initial layer.

3005000657,"Researchers Submit Patent Application, “Video Management System For Providing Video Management Operations Based On Video Credits Segment Detection In Video”, for Approval (USPTO 20200137456): Microsoft Technology Licensing LLC","2020 MAY 20 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Technology Business Daily -- From Washington, D.C., NewsRx journalists report that a patent application by the inventors HAUON, Edan (Herzliya, IL); JASSIN, Ohad (Tel Mond, IL); NURIELI, Daniel (Herzliya, IL), filed on October 24, 2018, was made available online on April 30, 2020.

The patent’s assignee is Microsoft Technology Licensing LLC (Redmond, Washington, United States).

News editors obtained the following quote from the background information supplied by the inventors: “Users often rely on video or video systems as an electronic medium for the recording, copying, playback, broadcasting, and display of moving visual media. Video on demand (VOD) is a type of video system or video management system that allows users to select and watch or listen to video or audio content such as movies and TV shows whenever they choose, rather than at a scheduled broadcast time, the method that prevailed with over-the-air programming. Video systems can support a variety of video features on a variety of media, including radio broadcast, magnetic tape, optical discs, computer files, and network streaming. An example video feature may specifically be closing credits or end credits, which are a list of the cast and crew of a particular motion picture, television program, or video game. With the ever-increasing use of video systems, improvements in computing operations, such as managing video systems based on identifying video features in video, can yield a result that overrides the routine and conventional sequence of events ordinarily associated with the video features in the video.”

As a supplement to the background information on this patent application, NewsRx correspondents also obtained the inventors’ summary information for this patent application: “Embodiments of the present invention relate to methods, systems, and computer storage media, for providing video management operations based on video credits segment detection. By way of background, video management systems provide support for executing video management operations using primarily marker-based models, which indicate a segment of video corresponding to video credits. For example, digital video files may include markers that indicate when video credits start, or alternatively, digital video files may include metadata (e.g., time codes) that correspond to different segments of the video, including a video credits segment. It can be tedious to manually implement marker-based models on all videos in a video management system library. As such, a comprehensive video management system with an alternative basis for executing video management operations can improve computing operations in video management systems.

“In operation, a video credits segment detection machine-learning system of a video management system can be accessed, where the video credits segment detection machine-learning system operates based on a video credits segment detection model. Video management systems may include different types of video-on-demand (‘VOD’) providers that manage and provide videos accessed using the VOD system. The video management system includes a video credits segment detection model that supports determining whether or not segments of videos are video credits segments of the videos. For example, video credits segment detection scores can be determined for corresponding videos, where the video credits segment detection scores indicate a likelihood that segments of videos are video credits segments of the videos. The video credits segment detection model is generated based on a plurality of video credits segment detection features that are explicitly and implicitly identified characteristics of single frames having video credits or multiple frames having video credits, which support defining the video credits segment detection model as a predictive model that determines whether or not the segment of the video is a video credits segment. A segment of video is then accessed, such that using the video credits segment detection model, an automatic determination of a video credits segment detection score for the segment of the video is made. Based on the video credits segment detection score, a video management operation is executed. The video management operations comprise instructions for performing functionality on the video management engine, a video client accessing the video, or on both.

“As such, the embodiments described herein improve computing operations, functionality, and the technological process for performing video management operations based video credits segment detection. In particular, the ordered combination of steps, for determining a video credits segment of a video, specify how interactions with the video are manipulated to yield a desired result. In particular, the result overrides the routine and conventional sequence of events ordinarily triggered by the video credits segment, which further results in efficiency in user navigation of graphical user interfaces of video management systems.

“This summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the detailed description. This summary is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used in isolation as an aid in determining the scope of the claimed subject matter.”
